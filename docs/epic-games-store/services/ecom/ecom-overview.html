			</div>
			<p>The Ecom Interface gives developers using Epic Online Services the ability to interact with the Epic Games Store. With this interface, you can manage products ranging from full games and downloadable content (DLC) to virtual goods and in-game currency. This includes making offers, completing purchase transactions, verifying ownership, and redeeming purchased items.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Tip</strong>: To help you better understand the Ecom Interface functionality, certain terms through this page are in
				<strong>bold</strong>. Definitions for these terms can be found in the
				<a href="#ecom-interface-glossary">Ecom Interface Glossary</a>
			</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To use the Ecom Interface, your product must have an Epic Account Services (EAS) application configured and must obtain
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/eos-data-privacy-visibility">user consent</a>
				to access Basic Profile data. You can set up an EAS application on the
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal">Developer Portal</a>
				or review the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services">Epic Account Services documentation</a>
				to learn more. Without EAS and user consent, you will be able to initialize the EOS SDK and the Ecom Interface, but all Ecom Interface function calls to the back-end service will fail.</p>
			<p>To access the Ecom Interface, acquire an
				<code>EOS_HEcom</code>
				handle through the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
				function,
				<code>EOS_Platform_GetEcomInterface</code>. All Ecom Interface functions require this handle as their first parameter. You must ensure that the
				<code>EOS_HPlatform</code>
				handle is ticking in order for callbacks to trigger when requests are completed.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Review the
					<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ownership Verification using Web API</a>
					documentation for using Web APIs with the Ecom Interface.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="operating-an-in-game-store">Operating an In-Game Store</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can operate an in-game store by carrying out two functions: presenting
				<strong>catalog offers</strong>
				(sometimes called
				<em>offers</em>) from the store, and enabling the user to purchase these catalog offers. The SDK provides functionality to retrieve lists of offers from the store's catalog to display in-game. Offer data includes one or more catalog items (sometimes called
				<em>audience</em>) that the user will gain after purchasing the offer, as well as release details that you can use to present information about the offer to the user.</p>
			<p>Once the user chooses to make a purchase, the checkout API pushes the data to the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/sdk-integration">overlay</a>, which displays the checkout flow for the user to finalize the purchase. When the purchase is completed, a callback is triggered to inform the game of the result of the transaction, providing a transaction handle so that the game can carry out
				<strong>fulfillment</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Purchase related functionality of the Ecom interface is disabled if the
					<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/sdk-integration">
						<code>EOS_PF_DISABLE_OVERLAY</code>
						flag</a>
					is set, or if the overlay is otherwise unavailable.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="catalog-offer-data">Catalog Offer Data</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Catalog offers (type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOffer</code>) contain localized pricing information and descriptive text, based on the puser browsing the store. Price localization includes applying discounts and converting to the local currency. A localized price will include a currency code, such as USD (which represents US dollars), and is represented in the smallest possible unit of that currency. For example, an offer that costs 2.99 US dollars would correspond to the value 299.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="presenting-the-stores-catalog">Presenting the Store's Catalog</h3>
			</div>
			<p>You can retrieve the list of catalog offers by calling the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOffers</code>
				function. This function takes an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOffersOptions</code>
				data structure and will call your delegate, of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOffersCallbackInfo</code>, upon completion. Initialize your
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOffersOptions</code>
				structure as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_ECOM_QUERYOFFERS_API_LATEST</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>LocalUserId</code>
						</td>
						<td>The
							<code>EOS_EpicAccountId</code>
							of the local user who is requesting the query</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>OverrideCatalogNamespace</code>
						</td>
						<td>Optional product sandbox, if different than the one specified during SDK initialization</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>If the
				<code>ResultCode</code>
				in the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOffersCallbackInfo</code>
				that the delegate receives indicates success, the offer data you requested is available in a temporary cache. Use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_GetOfferCount</code>
				to determine the number of offers stored in the cache, and
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CopyOfferByIndex</code>
				to get a copy of an individual offer (of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOffer</code>) from it. Each catalog item within the offer contains data about images and release details associated with that Item, which you can pull out separately. When you no longer need your copy of an Offer, use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOffer_Release</code>
				to release it.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="displaying-individual-item-data">Displaying Individual Item Data</h4>
			</div>
			<p>After retrieving an offer from the cache, you can call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_GetOfferItemCount</code>
				to determine how many catalog items that offer contains, and then use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CopyOfferItemByIndex</code>
				to retrieve a copy of an individual
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogItem</code>. This structure contains additional localized text as well as the ID of the entitlement that it will provide upon purchase. To release the memory allocated to your copy of the data, call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogItem_Release</code>.</p>
			<p>To retrieve release details for a catalog item from the cache, first use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_GetItemReleaseCount</code>
				to discover the number of data entries present. You can then use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CopyItemReleaseByIndex</code>
				to get an individual piece of data (of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogRelease</code>). Call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogRelease_Release</code>
				to release this data when you no longer need it.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="buying-from-the-store">Buying from the Store</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When a user buys something from the store, that user purchases a catalog offer. Once the purchase is complete, the user will own the catalog item(s) contained within the offer, each of which adds one or more
				<strong>entitlements</strong>
				to the buyer's user account.</p>
			<p>There are three actions involved in buying from the store: making the purchase, verifying ownership, and (optionally) redeeming entitlements.</p>
			<p>When a user decides to make a purchase, call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_Checkout</code>
				with an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CheckoutOptions</code>
				structure. Initialize the structure as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_ECOM_CHECKOUT_API_LATEST</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>LocalUserId</code>
						</td>
						<td>The
							<code>EOS_EpicAccountId</code>
							of the local user who is making the purchase</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>OverrideCatalogNamespace</code>
						</td>
						<td>Optional product sandbox, if different from the one specified during SDK initialization</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EntryCount</code>
						</td>
						<td>The number of
							<code>EOS_EcomCheckoutEntry</code>
							elements being supplied to this structure in the
							<code>Entries</code>
							parameter.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>Entries</code>
						</td>
						<td>An array of
							<code>EOS_Ecom_CheckoutEntry</code>
							elements, which contain the
							<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOfferId</code>
							data for each offer the user wishes to purchase, and the same
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
							as this structure</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>This information is used to generate a purchase token. The overlay is displayed, enabling the user to review the purchase, select payment options, and confirm or cancel the transaction. When the overlay closes, whether by succeeding, failing, or being canceled by the user, your callback (of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_OnCheckoutCallback</code>) will run with an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CheckoutCallbackInfo</code>
				parameter detailing the transaction. Within the callback information, the
				<code>TransactionId</code>
				will be non-null if the transaction succeeded, and null if it failed or was canceled.</p>
			<p>If any additional calls to
				<code>EOS_Ecom_Checkout</code>
				are made before the first returns via the callback, an
				<code>EOS_AlreadyPending</code>
				error will be returned.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="accessing-completed-purchase-data">Accessing Completed Purchase Data</h3>
			</div>
			<p>If you have a valid transaction ID following a successful user purchase, you can pass it to the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_CopyTransactionById</code>
				function to receive an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_HTransaction</code>.
				<code>EOS_Ecom_Transaction_GetEntitlementsCount</code>
				returns the number of entitlements associated with the transaction, and
				<code>EOS_Ecom_Transaction_CopyEntitlementByIndex</code>
				will retrieve an individual entitlement. Call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_Entitlement_Release</code>
				to release this data when you no longer need it.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Entitlements associated with transaction IDs contain the same data as those obtained through the
					<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryEntitlement</code>
					function, but are subject to a different caching policy. Because of this difference, entitlements that you acquire using a transaction ID following a purchase will remain in a transaction-specific cache until you explicitly call
					<code>EOS_Ecom_Transaction_Release</code>.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="verifying-ownership">Verifying Ownership</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Verifying ownership within the game client is not recommended and may be bypassed by users using software cheats. If possible, verify ownership on a trusted server using the
					<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ecom Web APIs</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="latest-recommendations-to-assist-with-preventing-piracy">Latest recommendations to assist with preventing piracy</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To help prevent piracy, we recommend that developers implement ownership verification checks for their game and any DLC. Online ownership verification on a trusted server/API is strongly recommended, and is generally considered the only effective way to prevent piracy. Client side verification can be used to mitigate low complexity attacks such as redistribution of the unmodified game files.</p>
			<p>For multiuser or online games:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Implement an ownership check on a trusted game server or back-end API using either the Ecom Interface or
						<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Web API</a>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>These checks are commonly implemented during authentication or when entering a level/match.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Deny access if the user does not pass the ownership check. If implemented properly, users should not be able to circumvent these checks by altering the API responses or modifying the game client itself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Monitor for accounts with abnormally high activity levels and apply bans if one account is shared with multiple end users.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We recommend limiting the number of concurrent sessions per account to 1.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For all games:</p>
			<p>While fully protecting against piracy using client side controls is not possible, there are several options for mitigating low effort attacks/sharing including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Verify the digital signature and SHA1 checksums of your game executable and all executable code (.exe/.dll/.so/etc) before invoking the ownership verification APIs. This includes verifying the EOS SDK and any other 3rd party libraries. Deny access if tampering is detected.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Require online activation and return a cryptographically verifiable token which enables offline access only after the user passes online verification.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>This token can be tied to specific hardware/user properties and expire after a predefined period.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>You must protect the embedded public key in your game binary from modifications for this to be effective.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Deny activation if the account in question activates too frequently or activates across many different devices.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Utilize commercially available obfuscation/anti-tamper solutions to increase the complexity of reverse engineering and modifying your tamper checks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Do not store DLC as part of the main game files. Distribute DLC content via the Epic Games Store or require an additional download which is gated by a server side ownership check.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Ecom Interface provides two methods for ownership verification: direct verification and token-based verification. Direct verification integrates directly with the Epic Entitlement Service, while token-based verification provides a signed token that the user can verify, or can pass to a third-party service. The direct method is useful for trusted game servers or less secure checks on client systems for simple validation. The token-based method provides a token that includes information about the game client, user, and
				<a href="#ecom-interface-glossary">Entitlement</a>
				as well as a signature that the game client or an external service can verify. If integrating with a third-party service that performs ownership verification, the token-based method is recommended because it avoids granting the outside service access to the user's data.</p>
			<p>If you prefer to access ownership information for your titles and services via RESTful endpoints, see the Ecom Web APIs.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="direct-ownership-verification">Direct Ownership Verification</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The recommended approach to verify user purchases is from your own back-end service, as this is not susceptible to malicious behavior from users. Please refer to the
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ecom Web API documentation</a>
				for details.</p>
			<p>To determine whether or not a user owns a specific catalog item, call
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnership</code>
				and pass in an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnershipOptions</code>
				structure. This will retrieve ownership information from the server and pass it to the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_OnQueryOwnershipCallback</code>
				callback function that you provide. The callback function will also receive a void pointer that you specify, which can contain any information your product requires to understand the context of the request. To begin, fill out the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnershipOptions</code>
				structure with the following information:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_ECOM_QUERYOWNERSHIP_API_LATEST</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>LocalUserId</code>
						</td>
						<td>The
							<code>EOS_EpicAccountId</code>
							of the local user whose ownership to query; needed for localization of Catalog Item description text and pricing information</td>

						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>CatalogNamespace</code>
						</td>
						<td>Optional product sandbox, if different than the one specified during SDK initialization</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Upon completion, the SDK will invoke your callback function with the data you requested (and your void pointer) stored in an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_OnQueryOwnershipCallback</code>
				structure. This structure contains an array of
				<code>EOS_Ecom_ItemOwnership</code>
				members, each of which describes one of the items you queried, and indicates whether the user owns it or not. Items that the server doesn't recognize will come back as not owned.</p>

			<p>The recommended approach to verify user purchases is from your own back-end service, as this is not susceptible to malicious behavior from users. Refer to the
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ecom Web API documentation</a>
				for details.</p>
			<p>To check ownership and cache the results locally for a few minutes, use
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnershipToken</code>. This function takes an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnershipTokenOptions</code>
				structure, initialized as follows:</p>
			<table>

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>When the operation completes, your callback function (of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_OnQueryOwnershipTokenCallback</code>) will receive an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryOwnershipTokenCallbackInfo</code>
				structure that includes a JSON Web Token (JWT) with a five-minute expiration time. You can verify the JWT with a public key, and unpack it to extract the Key ID. You may also send it along to a third-party service, which can then verify that the ownership information came from the Epic Games Store. The public key, retrieved by an additional web call or shared with your organization, will be in the form of a JSON Web Key (JWK) that can be used to verify the signature in the JWT. To make an HTTP request, send a GET to
				<code>https://ecommerceintegration-public-service-ecomprod02.ol.epicgames.com/ecommerceintegration/api/public/publickeys/{kid}</code>. A sample request follows:</p>

In some cases, fulfilling a purchase can be as simple as checking that the user owns a specific entitlement and applying some game logic to the result.

			<p>The recommended approach to verify user purchases is from your own back-end service, as this is not susceptible to malicious behavior from pusers. Please refer to the
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ecom Web API documentation</a>
				for details.</p>
			<p>After fulfilling a
				<strong>consumable entitlement</strong>, or managing its fulfillment through a third-party service, call the
				<code>EOS_Ecom_RedeemEntitlements</code>
				function with an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_RedeemEntitlementsOptions</code>
				structure. Initialize the structure as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_ECOM_REDEEMENTITLEMENTS_API_LATEST</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>LocalUserId</code>
						</td>
						<td>The ID of the user account that is redeeming entitlements</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>

							<code>EntitlementIdCount</code>
						</td>
						<td>The number of elements in
							<code>EntitlementIds</code>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EntitlementIds</code>
						</td>
						<td>The entitlements (of type
							<code>EOS_Ecom_EntitlementId</code>) to redeem</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Upon completion, your callback of type
				<code>EOS_Ecom_OnRedeemEntitlementsCallback</code>
				will receive an
				<code>EOS_Ecom_RedeemEntitlementsCallbackInfo</code>
				structure.</p>
			<div>
				<p>After redeeming an entitlement, it will no longer show up in the results from
					<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryEntitlements</code>
					calls, unless the
					<code>EOS_Ecom_QueryEntitlementsOptions</code>
					parameter has its
					<code>bIncludeRedeemed</code>
					set to
					<code>true</code>. Note that the Entitlement is still stored in the cache after it is redeemed. There is no way to clear the cache.</p>

						<td>
							<strong>Catalog Item</strong>
						</td>
						<td>A catalog item (also called an audience) can represent an entire game, virtual goods like in-game currency or weapon skins, or other types of downloadable content. A catalog item is used to define how entitlements are granted to accounts. You can configure catalog items to grant other catalog items. This lets you update associated offers over time. For example, you can allow season pass owners to seamlessly gain ownership rights for new DLC when it is released.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Catalog Offer</strong>
						</td>
						<td>A catalog offer (also called an offer) is a pairing of one or more catalog items and an associated price (which can be 0). When an offer is purchased, an entitlement is granted for each of the items contained in the offer.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Entitlement</strong>
						</td>
						<td>An entitlement is anything a user owns within the Epic Games Store infrastructure. An entitlement can grant access to one or more catalog items.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Consumable Entitlement</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Consumable entitlements have limited persistence, decreasing a use count each time the Item is used in game. This is commonly used for things like in-game currency, XP boosts, and other Items that can be used up and replenished with additional purchases. In some cases, an external service fulfills the entitlement. Once that external service has received the information about the entitlement, it is redeemed and its use count is decremented to 0, effectively removing it from the user account. The external service accepts responsibility for handling the in-game effects of the Item past that point.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Durable Entitlement</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Entitlements for purchases that persist, like certain forms of downloadable content, or even entire games.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Fulfillment</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Once a consumable entitlement is part of a user account, the entitlement still needs to be fulfilled. It can be implicit (checked by SDK APIs), or a third-party service can accept responsibility for the fulfillment through back-end service API calls.</td>

						<td>
							<strong>Catalog Offer ID</strong>
						</td>
						<td>A Catalog Offer ID is the unique identifier for an offer in the store. These IDs are unique within a Product. The checkout process requires a Catalog Offer ID.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Catalog Item ID</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Catalog item IDs are unique within a Product and identify a single catalog Item. You need this ID in order to check whether or not a specific user owns the corresponding catalog item.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Entitlement Name</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Each catalog item can have an entitlement name associated with it.  These entitlement names can be used for grouping. However, the entitlement name is usually the same value as the Catalog Item ID. The Ecom Interface allows querying for entitlements based on the entitlement name associated with the catalog item in the catalog offer that granted it.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Entitlement ID</strong>
						</td>
						<td>Fulfilled catalog offers and their catalog items manifest on the user account as a particular entitlement stored with that user. Each entitlement will have its own unique identifier. This ID is used by the ECom Interface when redeeming entitlements.</td>
