			<p>An
				<span>
					<span>organization</span>
				</span>
				is the highest level in the
				<strong>Epic Online Services (EOS)</strong>
				<span>
					<span>product</span>
				</span>
				management ecosystem. It encompasses all the products and the associated members, such as a publisher or game studio.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>Organization</em>
					- Epic Games
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em>Product</em>
							- Jazz Jackrabbit
							<ul>
								<li>
									<em>Sandbox</em>
									- Development
									<ul>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- DevGame01</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Sandbox</em>
									- Staging
									<ul>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- QATestGame01</li>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- AlphaGame</li>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- BetaGame</li>
									</ul>

			<p>When you create an
				<span>
					<span>account</span>
				</span>
				on the Developer Portal and are not a member of an existing organization, a new organization is created. For existing organizations, organization
				<strong>Admins</strong>
				can add or remove members and manage their roles through the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>Once created, Admins can also configure your organizationâ€™s entity type from the
				<strong>Settings</strong>
				tab in the Developer Portal under
				<strong>Organization</strong>. Your entity type can either be a company or an individual:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Enterprise</strong>
					- Available for incorporated entities and indicates that your organization represents a legal entity.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Individual</strong>
					- The default entity type for an organization and indicates that all of the members of the organization are acting on their personal behalf.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While both entity types allow an organization to access Epic Online Services, only Enterprise organizations can leverage the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store publishing tools</a>. Additionally, members of an Enterprise organization cannot use services within the Dev Portal until the necessary agreements have been completed for your organization.</p>
			<p>The
				<strong>Organization</strong>
				page of the Developer Portal is where you
				<a href="#member-management">manage</a>
				your  members, their
				<a href="#roles">roles</a>, view
				<a href="#licenses">licenses</a>, and configure your
				<a href="#console-developer-access">console developer access</a>.</p>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>
				<div>
					<p>If you are a member of more than one organization, at sign-in a prompt asks which organization you want to access. After you have signed in, you can select a different organization from the dropdown by your current organization's name in the top banner.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="member-management">Member Management</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Members of your organization are listed on the
				<strong>Member</strong>
				tab of your
				<strong>Organization</strong>
				page in the Developer Portal. Each member is granted a
				<a href="#roles">role</a>
				within the organization that gives them permission to different tools in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>To add a new member to your organization, click
				<strong>Invite</strong>
				on the
				<strong>Member</strong>
				tab. A prompt requests the email address of the new member, their role, and for which products. After pressing
				<strong>Invite</strong>, the new member is added to your organization once they accept the invitation.</p>
			<p>Once a member is part of your organization, an Admin can remove or change the access rights of a member by clicking on
				<strong>More Options</strong>
				for that member.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Each member has a role granting them permissions for different tools in the Developer Portal. You can create additional roles, but the default roles are listed on the
				<strong>Roles</strong>
				tab of your
				<strong>Organization</strong>
				page in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="adding-roles">Adding Roles</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Admins can create new roles for their organization by clicking
				<strong>New Role</strong>
				from the
				<strong>Roles</strong>
				tab. A modal slides open for you to name, describe, and choose access for the new role. Once satisfied with your selections, click
				<strong>Create</strong>
				to add it as another role option for your organization.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The
				<strong>Licenses</strong>
				tab organizes your active licenses and agreements for your organization and allows you to review them as needed.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="console-developer-access">Console Developer Access</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can only access console documentation if you have the appropriate permissions. See the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/services-quick-start#eos-sdk-download-types">Get Started Steps: EOS SDK Download Types</a>
				documentation for more information on how to access the EOS SDKs for consoles and their associated documentation.</p>
