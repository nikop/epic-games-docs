			<p>For products published to the Epic Games Store, you can enhance your product’s user experience with Epic Games Store achievements. These achievements extend the functionality of
				<a href="/docs/game-services/achievements">Epic Online Services achievements</a>
				and can be used to reward users with experience points (XP) for interacting with your product.</p>
			<p>The process for implementing Epic Games Store achievements for your product is outlined below. For general information about Epic Games Store achievements, review
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/services/epic-achievements/overview">Achievements Overview</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Products that support achievements through other PC storefronts that sell third-party products must also support Epic Games Store achievements. The achievements available to users on the Epic Games Store must be substantially similar to those offered through other storefronts.</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Web-based and HTML products are currently exempt from this requirement as they are not currently supported by the Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK.</li>
					<li>If a product in Early Access does not yet have a finalized set of base game achievements defined, you only need to implement
						<a href="/docs/game-services/achievements">Epic Online Services achievements</a>
						at the time of early release. Once ready for full release, Epic Games Store achievements must enabled.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Note</strong>: This requirement does
					<strong>not</strong>
					retroactively apply to any existing products available on the Epic Games Store or any products that were onboarded in the Dev Portal prior to March 9, 2023. However, enabling achievements is recommended to promote an optimal user experience.</p>
				<p>To learn more about our distribution requirements, review the

				<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To begin, follow the steps below to prepare your product for Epic Games Store achievements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="#step-1-sign-the-epic-online-services-developer-agreement">Sign the Epic Online Services Developer Agreement</a>.
					<ul>
						<li>Note: This step is only required once for your organization.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#steps-2-and-3-generate-and-select-sandboxes-and-deployments">Generate Dev and Stage sandboxes and deployments</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#steps-2-and-3-generate-and-select-sandboxes-and-deployments">Choose a deployment in each sandbox to use with Epic Games Store achievements</a>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-1-sign-the-epic-online-services-developer-agreement">Step 1: Sign the Epic Online Services Developer Agreement</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The owner of your organization must read and sign the updated Developer Agreement. You cannot use Epic Games Store achievements until this agreement has been accepted.</p>
			<p>To read and sign the agreement, the owner of your organization follows the steps below. Only the organization owner can complete this process. :</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Epic Games Store Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Developer Agreement section, click
					<strong>See Agreement</strong>.</li>
				<li>Review the Epic Online Services Developer Agreement and click
					<strong>Accept</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the agreement has been signed, continue to Steps 2 and 3 below.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="steps-2-and-3-generate-and-select-sandboxes-and-deployments">Steps 2 and 3: Generate and Select Sandboxes and Deployments</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The next step in setting up Epic Games Store achievements includes generating Dev and Stage sandboxes and deployments in your product. Once generated, you then select one
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip deployment" tabindex="0" role="button">deployment</span>
				</span>
				in each
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip sandbox" tabindex="0" role="button">sandbox</span>
				</span>
				as the primary deployment for use with Epic Games Store achievements. Epic Online Services associates all user data for a product, including achievement data, with a specific deployment.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: To learn more about sandboxes and deployments, review
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/product-management">Product Management</a>.</p>
			<p>To generate and select your sandboxes and deployments, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Epic Games Store Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Generate Sandboxes and Deployments section, click
					<strong>Generate</strong>
					to create new Dev and Stage sandboxes and associated deployments.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: If Dev and Stage sandboxes containing one or more deployments already exist for your product, skip this step and proceed to step 3.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the Select a Primary Deployment per Sandbox section, choose a primary deployment for each sandbox to contain your Epic Games Store achievements.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: For Dev and Stage, select the deployments you are using for pre-production QA. For Live, select the deployment associated with your live product.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Review your primary deployment selections. Then, click
					<strong>Submit</strong>
					to complete this process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the setup process is complete, you are ready to create your Epic Games Store achievements!</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="create-epic-games-store-achievements-for-your-product">Create Epic Games Store Achievements for Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>There are two ways to create Epic Games Store achievements for your product, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#upload-epic-games-store-achievements-in-bulk">Define multiple Epic Games Store achievements at once using bulk import</a>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>:This method is recommended if you have already added Epic Online Services achievements to your product.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#create-and-link-a-single-epic-games-store-achievement">Define Epic Games Store achievements one at a time using the Dev Portal interface</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sections below further describe each of these methods.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="upload-epic-games-store-achievements-in-bulk">Upload Epic Games Store Achievements in Bulk</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To add multiple Epic Games Store achievements to your product at once, use the bulk import process. This process involves defining your achievements in a downloaded file, then uploading that information to the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The bulk import process must be completed in the deployment linked to Epic Games Store achievements in your Dev sandbox.</li>
				<li>The bulk import process only allows you to upload either EOS achievements or Epic Games Store (EGS) achievements in a single import. You can't upload both EOS achievements and EGS achievements together in a single import.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To begin this process, select one of the following methods to retrieve your starting file:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#method-1-export-your-current-epic-online-services-achievements">Method 1</a>: Export your current Epic Online Services achievements from your Live deployment to a zip file. This option is recommended if you already have achievements defined for your product.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#method-2-download-the-epic-games-store-achievements-template">Method 2</a>: Download the Epic Games Store achievements template to create new achievements.</li>

			<div>
				<h4 id="define-and-upload-your-achievements">Define and upload your achievements</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Regardless of which starting method you chose, the next step consists of defining your Epic Games Store achievements in the downloaded file. The updated file is then uploaded to the Dev Portal to create your Epic Games Store achievements.</p>
			<p>To define and upload your Epic Games Store achievements, follow the process below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On your computer, extract the zip file you downloaded.</li>
				<li>Open the file labeled
					<em>achievementDefinitions.csv</em>.</li>
				<li>In the CSV file, ensure the last column is labeled
					<em>user_epic_achievements_xp</em>. If this column is not available, add it to the file.</li>
				<li>Populate the CSV file with the appropriate values for your achievements.
					<ul>
						<li>Ensure that you include any live Epic Online Services achievements in the file. If you

			<p>To review your achievements import, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Epic Games Store Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>Locate the
					<strong>Push to Stage</strong>
					button at the top of the page.
					<ul>
						<li>If the button is enabled, your achievements passed validation and satisfy the XP requirements.</li>
						<li>If the button is disabled, your achievements do not meet the XP requirements. Expand the message to review the details of the failed validation. Common errors include missing or incorrect XP values, an XP total that does not equal 1000, incorrect icon file sizes, or exceeded character limits.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If one or more errors are present in your achievements, resolve those issues in your CSV file. Then, update your zip archive and reupload the archive following the bulk import process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can validate your Epic Games Store achievements in your product before you push them to Stage. To do so, create a build of your product using the Dev sandbox and deployment associated with your achievements during
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface#platform-interface">SDK initialization</a>.</p>
			<p>If you push your achievements to Live, you can preview them on the Product Detail Page and Achievement Details Page. To do so, first push your achievements to Stage for

				<h3 id="create-and-link-a-single-epic-games-store-achievement">Create and Link a Single Epic Games Store Achievement</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When you create an Epic Games Store achievement, you link it to an Epic Online Services achievement and assign it an experience point (XP) value. If you do not have a corresponding Epic Online Service achievement available, you can create one through the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				This section explains how to create and link a single Epic Games Store achievement. If you already have Epic Online Services achievements in your product or wish to create multiple achievements, following the process for
				<a href="#upload-epic-games-store-achievements-in-bulk">bulk uploading Epic Games Store achievements</a>
				is strongly recommended.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="create-a-corresponding-epic-online-services-achievement">Create a Corresponding Epic Online Services Achievement</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Before you can create an Epic Games Store achievement, you must have a corresponding Epic Online Services achievement to associate it with. There are two ways to define Epic Online Services achievements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write some corresponding code in your product before you launch. To learn more, review
					<a href="/docs/game-services/achievements">Epic Online Services achievements</a>.</li>
				<li>Base each Epic Online Services achievement on a
					<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-stats-interface">stat</a>. For example, to create an achievement that rewards users for traveling a certain distance in a game, first create a stat to track player travel distance. Then, associate the achievement with that stat.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To create an Epic Online Services achievement, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Epic Online Services Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Deployment drop-down, select the deployment associated with your Dev sandbox.</li>
				<li>From the options in the top right, click
					<strong>Create New</strong>.</li>
				<li>To base this achievement on a stat, select the desired option from the drop-down. Then, enter the stat value that unlocks the achievement.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>Complete the Create New Achievement form as appropriate:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Achievement ID</strong>: A unique value that identifies the achievement.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Select Locale</strong>: The locale for the provided achievement name and description. Unique sets of Epic Games Store achievements can be created for each language the Epic Games Store supports, as needed.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Visibility</strong>: Determines whether the achievement is displayed to product users before they unlock it.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Unlocked Icon</strong>: The image the Social Overlay or your product displays to users after they unlock the achievement.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Locked Icon</strong>: The image displayed to users before they unlock the achievement. Note that this icon is
							<strong>not</strong>
							used by Epic Games Store achievements; instead, Epic Games Store users see a semi-transparent version of the unlocked icon with a superimposed lock.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Locked Display Name</strong>: The name displayed to users before they unlock the achievement.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Locked Description</strong>: The description displayed to users before they unlock the achievement.</li>

			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Epic Online Services Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Deployment drop-down, select the deployment associated with your Dev sandbox.</li>

			<p>Once your Epic Games Store achievements have been reviewed and approved, you can push them live to make them available to users. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Game Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements</strong>
					and select
					<strong>Epic Games Store Achievements</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Deployment drop-down, select the Stage sandbox.</li>
				<li>From the options to the top right, click
					<strong>Push to Live</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: After an Epic Games Store achievement is live, you cannot adjust its XP value or remove the achievement through the Dev Portal.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To delete a published achievement, contact support by
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">creating a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site.</li>
				<li>To update any text or images associated with your achievements, follow the normal publishing flow.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="xp-requirements-for-epic-games-store-achievements">XP Requirements for Epic Games Store Achievements</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When setting XP (experience point) values for Epic Games Store achievements, you must adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each product must have exactly 1,000 XP* in total, regardless of how many achievements are defined. The total XP currently used for a product displays in the Dev Portal under Your Product &gt; Games Services &gt; Progression &gt; Achievements &gt; Epic Games Store Achievements.
					<ul>
						<li>An error message displays if you try to add more or less than 1,000 XP for a specific product.</li>
						<li>Achievements cannot be pushed from Dev to Stage if the product’s total XP does not exactly equal 1,000 (i.e., the total XP cannot be more or less than 1,000).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The XP value for individual achievements must be a multiple of 5 (e.g.,  5, 10, 15, 100, 110, 200, etc.).</li>
				<li>The minimum XP for a single achievement is 5, and the maximum is 200.</li>
				<li>Epic Games Store achievements are classified in bronze, silver, and gold tiers, as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Bronze</strong>: 5-45 XP</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Silver</strong>: 50-95 XP</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Gold</strong>: 100-200 XP</li>
						<li>An additional platinum tier achievement is available for users who earn a total of 1,000 XP from a single product.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<p>*If you plan to add DLC with achievements or require more than 1,000 total XP across your achievements, contact your Technical Account Manager or
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site for assistance.</p>
