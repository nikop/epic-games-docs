			</div>
			<p>The BuildPatch tool (BPT) is a command line tool that allows you to securely upload binary files for your product to the Dev 
				<!-- -->sandbox
				<!-- --> for your product. You can then use the Artifacts and Binaries section of the Dev Portal to attach binaries to the correct artifact for your product offer and conduct testing. (For some organizations, this section may be labeled as
				<em>Builds</em>.) Using the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/release-management">Release Management</a>
				process, you can promote binaries uploaded via the BuildPatch tool between sandboxes.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="before-you-start">Before You Start</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Before you begin, review the sections below to gather the information needed in preparation for using the BuildPatch tool.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="download-the-buildpatch-tool">Download the BuildPatch Tool</h3>
			</div>
			<p>You can download the BuildPatch tool (BPT) from the Artifacts and Binaries page of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Artifacts and Binaries</strong>.</li>
				<li>To the top right, click
					<strong>Download Tool</strong>.</li>
				<li>After the download finishes, install the tool on your local machine.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="retrieve-credential-ids">Retrieve Credential IDs</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To ensure you have the information needed to use the BPT, retrieve the following IDs from the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Client ID and Client Secret for the Product</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Any user in your organization with Owner, Admin, or Store roles can retrieve the following credentials:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Product Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the
					<strong>General</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>Locate the Build Patch Tool Credentials section and save the client ID and secret.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Artifact Name and ID for the Offer</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Artifacts and Binaries</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the list, click the name of the offer for which you wish to retrieve credentials.</li>
				<li>On the Manage Artifact screen, click the
					<strong>arrow icon</strong>
					to the right of Edit Details.</li>
				<li>Save the artifact name and ID.</li>
				<li>Repeat as needed for additional offers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Offer IDs for the Offer</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Offers</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the list, click the name of the offer for which you wish to retrieve credentials.</li>
				<li>On the Offer Details screen, locate the IDs section and save the offer ID.</li>
				<li>Repeat as needed for additional offers.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="review-paths-on-the-command-line">Review Paths on the Command Line</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Due to the way the command prompt interprets
				<code>\"</code>
				(a backslash directly followed by a double quote) on the command line, you need to follow at least one of the following pieces of guidance when specifying paths in BuildPatchTool arguments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not append a trailing slash to your directory names.</li>
				<li>Use forward slashes for directory separators.</li>
				<li>Do not enclose paths in quotes (this is not possible if your path contains one or more spaces).</li>
				<li>Escape only the trailing backslash with another backslash if it is double-quote enclosed (not recommended, as is error prone)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Examples of Valid Path Syntax</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot="D:/MyFolder/"
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot=D:\MyFolder\
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot=D:\MyFolder
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot=D:/MyFolder/
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot=D:/MyFolder
					</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>-BuildRoot="D:\MyFolder\\"
					</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Invalid Path Syntax</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The following syntax
				<strong>does not work</strong>
				when defining a path on the Command Line:</p>
			<p>
				<code>-BuildRoot="D:\MyFolder\"</code>

			<p>Extract the contents of the
				<a href="https://launcher-public-service-prod06.ol.epicgames.com/launcher/api/installer/download/BuildPatchTool.zip">BuildPatchTool ZIP</a>
				file to a machine that has access to the 
				<!-- -->binary
				<!-- --> you want to upload.  The machine will also need Internet access to communicate with the Epic backend.</p>
			<div>
				<p>The ZIP file link is always kept up to date with the newest version of the BPT. If you cannot access the file,
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site for assistance.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Authentication is carried out by supplying a
				<code>Client ID</code>
				and
				<code>Client Secret</code>
				to BuildPatchTool. These must be provided for every operation using command line arguments.  These credentials are available in the Dev Portal under Your Product &gt; Product Settings &gt; General tab &gt; Build Patch Tool Credentials.</p>
			<div>
				<p>BuildPatchTool uses a unique
					<code>Client ID</code>
					and
					<code>Client Secret</code>, separate from any EOS Client IDs your game may use. Ensure you use the Build Patch Tool Credentials available in the Product Settings section of the Dev Portal. Clients listed under SDK Credentials cannot be used with this tool.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The
				<code>ClientId</code>
				parameter must be provided with every operation that interacts with Epic's backend services. The client secret must be provided by using either of the
				<code>ClientSecret</code>
				or
				<code>ClientSecretEnvVar</code>
				parameters.</p>
			<p>If using the
				<code>ClientSecret</code>
				parameter, then your client secret should be passed verbatim as the value of the parameter:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<div>
							<div style="color:#fff">
								<span style="display:inline-block">
								</span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>If using the
				<code>ClientSecretEnvVar</code>
				parameter, then you pass the name of an OS environment variable which contains the client secret:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>
						<div>
							<div style="color:#fff">
								<span style="display:inline-block">
								</span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>We recommend using the</strong>
				<code>ClientSecretEnvVar</code>
				<strong>parameter whenever possible, as this prevents the value of your secret appearing in system logs and command line history.</strong>
				It is a best practice to store your client secret in a secrets management system (such as Hashicorp Vault), and securely inject into your build machine's environment during each run.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="how-to-upload-a-binary">How to Upload a Binary</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Navigate to the
				<code>Engine/Binaries/Win64/</code>
				directory. From a command line, run BuildPatchTool.exe in UploadBinary mode, and point it at your binary (see CLI argument details below).</p>
			<p>This will process your binary , upload it to our cloud storage, and register the binary with our backend:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

							<div style="color:#fff">
								<span style="display:inline-block">
								</span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>Descriptions for each of the parameters that you have to specify are below. You can also add the "-help" option after any mode (e.g.
				<code>"BuildPatchTool.exe -mode=PatchGeneration -help"</code>) to get information about the required arguments.</p>

						<td>A directory where BuildPatchTool can save files to be uploaded, this can be empty each run. As with the BuildRoot, this can be an absolute or a relative path. (This location is used to cache information about existing binaries, and should be a different directory from the BuildRoot parameter. It is OK if this directory is initially empty; BuildPatchTool will download information as needed from the Epic backend and store it in the CloudDir.)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>BuildVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>The version string for the build. This needs to be unique for each build of a specific artifact, independent of platform. For example,
							<code>BuildVersion-1.0</code>
							can only exists for Windows or Mac, not both. The build version string has the following restrictions: Must be between 1 and 100 chars in length, whitespace is not allowed, should only contain characters from the following sets a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or .+-_</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>AppLaunch</code>
						</td>

							<code>FileAttributeList (Optional)</code>
						</td>
						<td>A path to a text file containing a list of files and corresponding special attributes (e.g. executable bit) that should be set. See Setting Special File Attributes section for a description of the file contents. Note that the attributes file should not be inside your BuildRoot to ensure that it does not get erroneously included in your binary upload.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>FileIgnoreList (Optional)</code>
						</td>
						<td>A path to a text file containing a list of files that should be excluded from the generated patch data. Each entry should be on a new line, and be a relative path from BuildRoot. A forward slash ("/") separator should be used. Note that if the ignore file is located inside BuildRoot then its own relative file path needs to be included in the ignore list to avoid it being included in the patch data.</td>
					</tr>

			<div>
				<h3 id="setting-special-file-attributes">Setting Special File Attributes</h3>
			</div>
			<p>You can use the optional
				<code>-FileAttributeList</code>
				parameter with the PatchGeneration mode to apply special attributes to files within your binary, such as executable, or tagging groups of files. Note that the launch app (as specified by the -<code>AppLaunch</code>
				argument) is automatically marked as executable and does not need to be explicitly included in this configuration file. If you do not need to set any special attributes, the -<code>FileAttributeList</code>
				argument can be omitted.</p>
			<p>Your custom
				<code>FileAttributeList</code>
				file must be a text file with one or more newline-separated entries. Each line must contain a quoted (BuildRoot-relative) filepath, followed by one or more space-delimited attributes to be applied to the referenced file:</p>
			<p>
				<code>"&lt;QuotedRelativePathToFile&gt;" &lt;list of attributes&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="example-entries">Example entries</h4>
			</div>
			<p>
				<code>"Relative/Path/To/My/file.bin" executable tag:my_tag</code>
				<code>"Second/Path/To/A/file.txt" tag:txt_files
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>The following file attribute flags are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>executable</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>tag:my_tag</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>File tagging is used for providing input to Epic Games Launcher's selective download feature, exposed in installation options screens. If you feel you need to use this feature, please contact an Epic Games representative, as the feature is still in beta.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="setting-the-desktop-shortcut-icon">Setting the Desktop Shortcut Icon</h3>
			</div>
			<p>By default, the desktop shortcut icon will be set to the icon of the app executable indicated by the AppLaunch argument. There are two ways of updating this icon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Updating the icon embedded in the app executable</li>
				<li>Adding a separate .ico file with same file name as the app executable (for example: launch.ico should be used if the executable is launch.exe)</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="how-to-label-a-binary">How to Label a Binary</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				If your organization is using the
				<strong>self-service</strong>
				Epic Games Store publishing tools, labeling your binary via the BuildPatch Tool is not currently supported. Instead, you can add the appropriate platforms to your artifacts through the Dev Portal. When a platform is assigned to an artifact, the artifact automatically receives the
				<em>Live</em>
				label. For more information, review
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-artifacts#upload-the-binary">Manage Artifacts</a>
			</div>
			<p>After the chunking and upload process has completed, you must apply a label to your binary to make it accessible from the Epic Games Launcher. Applying a label to a binary associates a label name (e.g. "Live") and a platform (e.g. "Win32") with a single binary version. Multiple labels can be assigned to the same binary.</p>
			<p>The EpicGamesLauncher client will only ever query for binaries associated with the platform on which it is currently running. For example, the Win32 Launcher client will only ever query with a platform of Win32, so it will never receive binaries labeled with Windows or Mac. A Windows x64 client will only query for binaries using the Windows platform, and so on. If you do actually have a single binary that is compatible with multiple platforms (for example, one compatible with both Windows and Win32), then you can apply two labels (one for each platform) to the same binary to make it available for both platforms without having to re-upload it.</p>

			<p>BuildPatchTool uses a general patching system for all binaries uploaded using the
				<em>UploadBinary</em>
				mode. The system allows the Epic Games store to update any version of your binary on a user's machine to any other version, minimising the download size to do so.</p>
			<p>The
				<em>BinaryDeltaOptimise</em>
				mode is designed to take two binaries already uploaded to the Epic Services and produce a smaller download for users who are updating between these two specific versions. We call this an A-to-B patch. Running this command is an optional step that can be taken to improve the user experience when releasing a larger than usual patch, with the majority of your players known to be on a specific binary version (binary "A").</p>
			<p>The following is a sample command line to improve delta patching between two binaries:</p>

			<p>When running in
				<em>BinaryDeltaOptimise</em>
				mode, BuildPatchTool will stream the existing binary data from our cloud network, re-analyze, and upload new A-to-B specific patch data. This process can take longer than the standard PatchGeneration mode if the original download size between
				<code>BuildVersionA</code>
				and
				<code>BuildVersionB</code>
				is large.</p>
			<p>It is generally advised to run
				<em>BinaryDeltaOptimise</em>
				mode using your current Live binary as
				<code>BuildVersionA</code>, and a binary you will release next as
				<code>BuildVersionB</code>. Ideally, plan to complete this process several days before your release in case of any issues running the tool, such as network loss.</p>
			<p>To check on your current Live binary version, you can make use of the ListBinaries mode. If
				<em>BinaryDeltaOptimise</em>
				was already run between the two provided BuildVersion values, the process will succeed short circuiting the operation, indicated in the output.</p>

				<h2 id="downloadable-content-dlc">Downloadable Content (DLC)</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games store provides full support for Downloadable Content (DLC). The operation of BuildPatchTool is exactly the same for DLC as it is for full games, with the following additional notes:</p>
			<p>Each item of DLC will be given its own, unique Artifact ID. Accordingly, each item of DLC will need its own patch generation process to be executed with the appropriate Artifact ID specified. Because each is generated separately, then it is important when performing patch generation for a DLC item that the base game, and all other DLC items are not present at the same time in the folder specified in the BuildRoot parameter during the patch generation process. Alternatively, if the BuildRoot folder does contain the main game or other DLC items, then a -FileIgnoreList parameter can be specified on the BuildPatchTool command line to exclude them from being included in the generated binary (see the ::How to Upload a Binary:: for more details).</p>
			<p>When installed on end users’ machines, the main game and all items of related DLC will be installed into the same directory. This leads to the restriction that there must be no files within the main game or any item of DLC which share a common file path. The BuildPatchTool will perform checks on this and prevent the patch generation process from occurring if there are any files which violate this rule. This means that the base game must be able to locate installed DLC by relative path from its install location.</p>
			<p>In the short-term, Artifact IDs for DLC items will be allocated to you by Epic, and the association between the main game and the DLC item will be provisioned as part of that process. Longer term, we will look to incorporate this provisioning into a self-service operation on the Developer Portal.</p>

			<p>When troubleshooting an error, review the following potential issues first:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Check Path syntax -
					<code>BuildRoot="D:\MyFolder\"</code>
					- WILL NOT WORK</li>
				<li>Ensure spaces have been added between all arguments.</li>
				<li>Files included in the build are subject to Windows MAX_PATH limits (limit of 260 characters); if the upload process is failing unexpectedly, ensure all file path locations do not exceed this limit.</li>
				<li>Most BuildPatchTool arguments are typically provided as absolute paths or relative to the working directory, but the AppLaunch argument must be provided only relative to the BuildRoot location.</li>
				<li>CloudDir contents will grow over time as more builds are processed on the same machine. However, this folder can be cleared at any time without negative impact.</li>
