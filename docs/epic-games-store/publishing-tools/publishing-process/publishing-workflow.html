			<p>The Epic Games Store publishing tools provide you with everything you need to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store. With these tools, you can maintain your productâ€™s store presence, create offers, manage price tiers, and more.</p>
			<p>To ensure a successful launch of your product on the storefront, follow our recommended publishing tools workflow. This workflow consists of five primary phases:</p>
			<ul>

			<p>Before getting started with the publishing tools, review the sections below to gain an understanding of the distribution flow. For each phase, technical steps and additional resources are provided to help you successfully launch your product on the Epic Games Store!</p>
			<div>
				An estimated time to complete is provided for each phase to assist you with release planning efforts. Note that these timelines serve as
				<strong>general guidelines only</strong>
				and are subject to change. Timelines can vary due to a variety of factors, such as unique business needs, volume, or the level of configuration required.

			<p>By default, new organizations can follow the standard onboarding process (<a href="/docs/en-US#onboarding">outlined below</a>) to access the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>If you already have an organization but have not yet implemented any Epic services for your product</strong>, the quickest way to access the publishing tools is to create a new organization and product in the
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/">Dev Portal</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>If you have an organization with a product currently using Epic Online Services or Epic Account Services</strong>, reach out to the Epic Games Store team for assistance with enabling the publishing tools.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you already have a product using Epic services, or otherwise wish to retain your current organization, request assistance by
				<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/">creating a private discussion</a>
				on our Developer Support site. Set the Topic to
				<em>Epic Games Store</em>
				and include the following in your request:</p>
			<ul>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Create your product by clicking

			<p>Once the Onboarding phase is complete, you can publish your product page to the storefront.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If your product has not yet been released, complete this phase to spread early awareness of your product. We recommend publishing your product page when you announce your product to ensure users know it will be available on the Epic Games Store. This also allows users to wishlist your product and receive notifications (if they have opted-in).</li>
				<li>If you have already released your product on other storefronts, you can optionally skip this step and proceed to
					<a href="/docs/en-US#finalize-and-test-configurations">Finalize and Test Configurations</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To publish your product page for early discovery, you must provide preliminary configurations for the following entities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Store Settings</li>
				<li>Offers</li>
				<li>Pages</li>
				<li>Localization (<em>recommended</em>)</li>
			</ul>
			<div>You do not need to fully configure these entities at this point in the workflow. During the
