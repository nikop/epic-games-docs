			<p>Brand review enables your game (or software application) to integrate with EOS Epic Account Services. The brand review process verifies your game’s brand with Epic Games. Your brand is the company or real-world organization that is associated with your product.</p>
			<p>Brand review protects you, all your players (users), and Epic Games from malicious activities, such as brand spoofing, phishing, malware, stolen identity, and copyright infringement.</p>
			<p>EOS Epic Account Services includes functionality such as the Presence Interface, the Auth Interface for authentication, and the Friends Interface.
				<br>
				For information on these interfaces, see the relevant documentation:</p>

				<h2 id="about-brand-review">About Brand Review</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Until Epic Games has verified your brand, only players with Epic Games accounts that are members of your organization can use your game's integration of EOS Epic Account Services.</p>
			<p>When your brand is verified, Epic Games removes this restriction and any player with an Epic Games account (known as "an Epic Games user") can use your game's integration of EOS Epic Account Services.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note on the terms “product” and “application”</strong>
				<br>
				In the Developer Portal during the brand review process, note the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“product” represents your game or software application. (For example, the game “Fall Guys”.)</li>
				<li>“application” represents an implementation of your product for Epic Account Services. An application associated with your product has settings for brand, user permissions (consent), and linked clients. (For example, the settings for Fall Guys' brand, user permissions and linked clients in Epic Account Services is an application.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This set of brand review pages use “product” to mean game or software application and "application" to mean a product's Epic Account Services settings.</p>

			<p>When reviewing your brand details, the Epic Games moderation team applies a set of guidelines that might evolve over time to reflect changes to the features that Epic Games provides, or any regulations.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You must have a publicly accessible website for your brand that contains an overview of your product.</li>
				<li>Your privacy policy demonstrates intent to use end user account information with respect and in a manner that complies with applicable law and Epic Games’ requirements.
					<ul>
						<li>You must have a public privacy policy.</li>
						<li>It must include contact info so customers can contact you with privacy concerns.</li>
						<li>It must be descriptive in how data will be handled for customers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The brand content does not contain third party intellectual property not owned by or adequately licensed to you.</li>
				<li>The brand content does not attempt to misrepresent or deceive end users about the product owner’s identity.</li>
				<li>The brand content does not contain or represent illicit or illegal material.</li>
