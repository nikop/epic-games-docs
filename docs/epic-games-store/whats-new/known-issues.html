			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store publishing tools are undergoing maintenance on January 19 beginning at 7:00 p.m. ET and continuing for multiple hours. During this time, the Epic Games Store section of the Dev Portal will be inaccessible, and you will not be able to review or update your product configuration. Other areas of the Dev Portal, such as the Organization section, will remain accessible during this time.</p>
			<div>
				<p>
					<strong>Action Recommended</strong>: If you have scheduled your product or any configurations to be pushed to the Live sandbox during this window,
					<strong>the push to Live will not occur</strong>. To avoid any interruptions, reschedule your update for either before maintenance begins or the day after the scheduled window. To learn more, review the Dates section of
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-offers#dates">Manage Offers</a>.</p>
				<p>Maintenance only impacts updates involving promotion between sandboxes. Scheduled updates regarding store visibility will still occur for products already in the Live sandbox (i.e., if your product is already in the Live sandbox and is set to become visible on the storefront during this window, your product will become available at that scheduled time.)</p>

				<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store team is currently aware of the following issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Store Analytics</strong>
					An issue involving the collection of store analytics is currently impacting the following reports in the Dev Portal. To monitor this issue, visit
					<a href="/docs/en-UShttps://status.epicgames.com/">status.epicgames.com</a>.
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>Wishlists (Daily and Age)</li>
						<li>CCU (Streaming and Daily Max)</li>
						<li>UTM Campaign Conversion</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Push to Stage</strong>: Promotion to the Stage sandbox may take several minutes after making even small changes. If the submission is still processing after 10 minutes,
					<a href="/docs/en-UShttps://epicsupport.force.com/epicgamesstoreknowledgebase/s/contactsupport">contact support</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Not Sellable/Bundle Only option</strong>: While enabling this option for an offer prevents users from directly purchasing it, the offer remains visible in the storefront. Any user who attempts to purchase the offer experiences an error during checkout and cannot complete the purchase.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Localization template</strong>: Before uploading localization content, you currently must remove any columns for languages you have not translated. Inclusion of empty columns results in an error when uploading the template.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Display Name field</strong>: The name entered when creating a product is only used within the Developer Portal. A future update will make the label of this field more specific.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Agreements</strong>: You cannot use a screen magnifier or operating system dictation feature to assist you when you view an agreement.</li>
