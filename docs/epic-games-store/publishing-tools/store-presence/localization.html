			</div>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can manage localized content for your store presence by visiting
				<em>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Localization</em>.</p>
			<p>The Localization section provides a downloadable template that is used to collect localized content for your various entities, such as
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/store-config">store settings</a>,
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-offers">offers</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-pages">pages</a>. If you are unable to provide your own translations, the Epic Games Store offers a complimentary translation service to partners.</p>
			<p>To get started, review the following sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#create-text-localizations">Create Text Localization</a>
				</li>
				<li>

			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="create-text-localizations">Create Text Localizations</h3>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>Before you begin, ensure the necessary fields for the entities you wish to translate have been completed in English. English content is required for all products distributed on the Epic Games Store, and this content is used to populate the localization template.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Character limits for individual text fields are applied consistently across all languages. To ensure localized content strings can be imported without issue, we recommend keeping English (en) text to no more than 70â€“80% of the maximum character limit.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Once your entities are ready, follow the process below to localize your content:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#step-1-download-the-localization-template">Download the localization template</a>

				</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h4 id="step-1-download-the-localization-template">Step 1: Download the Localization Template</h4>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>To start the process, you must first download the localization template. The localization template is a .CSV file containing all user-facing content strings for your selected entities.</p>
			<p>Once retrieved, you will add your translations to this template as needed. If you cannot provide your own translations, review the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#request-text-translations-from-the-epic-translation-service">Request Text Translations from the Epic Translation Service</a>
				section for more information.</p>
			<p>To retrieve the localization template, complete the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Localization</strong>.</li>
				<li>Ensure the
					<strong>Dev</strong>
					sandbox is selected. Then, click
					<strong>Download Template</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select one or more entities to localize. Then, click
					<strong>Download</strong>
					to export the template.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once downloaded, continue to
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#step-2-complete-the-localization-template">Step 2: Complete the Localization Template</a>
				to populate the .CSV file with your translations. If you have already created one or more localizations, the file may already contain data in certain locale columns.</p>
			<div>
				<p>If you have some entities that support complete localization (i.e., content provided for all locales) and other entities that do not fully support localization (i.e., content provided for only some locales), it is recommended that you download and complete these templates separately. For example, if your Product Home is to be fully localized, but Product Configuration is not, manage these templates separately as follows:</p>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Download the Product Home template and provide localizations for all locale columns. Upload Product Home Page template.</li>
					<li>Download the Product Configuration template and provide localizations in one or more locale columns as needed. Remove any columns that do not contain localizations. Upload the Product Configuration template.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="step-2-complete-the-localization-template">Step 2: Complete the Localization Template</h4>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>Next, fill out the localization template with your translated content.</p>
			<p>In the .CSV file, each row represents a specific string, with the
				<code>en</code>
				column containing your English content. Additional locale columns are provided to collect your translated strings for each supported language.</p>
			<p>Locale columns are labeled by locale code (e.g.,
				<code>ja</code>
				or
				<code>ko</code>). For a full list of codes, review the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#supported-languages">Supported Languages</a>
				section.</p>
			<div>
				<p>To ensure a successful import of your localization template,
					<strong>do not</strong>
					change the template structure of the .CSV file.
					<strong>Do not</strong>
					edit or remove the first row (header) of the template or adjust the file format. Changes to the template structure or file format may cause an import to fail.</p>
			</div>
			<p>To complete the localization template, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the .CSV file, review the
					<code>Localization Field</code>,
					<code>Field Description</code>, and
					<code>en</code>
					columns to identify the strings requiring translation.</li>
				<li>For each string, add your translated content to each locale column as needed.</li>
				<li>Remove any locale columns that are not being used. Your completed file should only include locale columns that contain translated content.</li>
				<li>Save your completed template as a .CSV UTF8 file.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h4 id="step-3-import-localizations">Step 3: Import Localizations</h4>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>Once your template is finalized, follow the steps below to upload the file and import your localizations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Localization</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Upload File</strong>. Then, upload your completed .CSV file. The max file size is 5MB.

							<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#step-4-preview-localizations">Step 4: Preview Localizations</a>.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>If the import presented errors</strong>: If any issues are detected in the file, an alert message displays on screen. These errors must be resolved before you can continue.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Errors during the import process may occur for a variety of reasons. Common errors include translated content for a specific field exceeding its character limit or translated content missing for one or more required fields.</p>
			<p>Languages affected by one or more errors display with a warning icon in the Languages section of the screen.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Click an affected language to review its specific error details. Using this information, resolve any issues in your .CSV file. Then, upload the modified file using the steps above.</li>
				<li>Repeat this process as needed to resolve any additional errors. Once you have successfully imported your localizations without error, continue to
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#step-4-preview-localizations">Step 4: Preview Localizations</a>.</li>

				<h4 id="step-4-preview-localizations">Step 4: Preview Localizations</h4>

			<div>
				<h4 id="step-5-publish-localizations">Step 5: Publish Localizations</h4>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>To publish your localizations, you first must push the localized entities to the Stage
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/release-management">sandbox</a>
				and submit them for review. Once approved, you can then publish your changes to the Live sandbox.</p>

			</ol>
			<p>After you have created one or more localizations, you can manage this information through the Dev Portal. For more information, review the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/localization#localization-management">Localization Management</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<p>During the review process, the Epic Games Store team may provide feedback that requires content changes in English. In this scenario, you must also update any associated translations before resubmitting your entities for review.</p>

				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>While not required, localizing your store presence is highly recommended to help your product reach a wider audience of Epic Games Store users.</p>
			<p>To support your localization efforts, the Epic Games Store offers the Epic Translation Service. If you are unable to provide your own localizations, you can request complimentary text translations from this service.</p>
			<p>To request text translations, follow the steps below. Note that this process may take
				<strong>two weeks or more</strong>
				to complete.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, ensure your entities (i.e., store settings, offers, and pages) have been completed in English.</li>
				<li>Download the localization template by following the process described in

				<h3 id="create-asset-localizations">Create Asset Localizations</h3>
				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
