			<p>The Epic Games Store does not require all products on the storefront to be rated by an official rating authority. However, ratings are required in the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some regions, such as South Korea or Australia, require ratings from specific authorities in order to distribute products in those areas.</li>
				<li>Products that have received ratings from
					<strong>any</strong>
					official rating authority must display those ratings on their product page in the storefront.</li>
				<li>Products leveraging blockchain or NFT technology in any capacity must be rated in order to be distributed on the Epic Games Store.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can choose to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store as an unrated title in regions without specific requirements. However, unrated products are treated as having the highest-level maturity rating available in regions where they are distributed.</p>
			<p>To best reach potential users on the storefront, obtaining ratings for your product is
				<strong>highly recommended</strong>. If you do not have ratings for your product, you can easily obtain an IARC rating through the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Products with Adults Only ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<strong>Note</strong>: The Epic Games Store makes an exception for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology. However, these products must comply with our
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/distribution-requirements/blockchain">Blockchain Technology Guidelines</a>
					and
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</a>, including our prohibitions on pornography, gambling, and hateful content.</p>

				<h2 id="iarc-ratings">IARC Ratings</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The
				<a href="https://www.globalratings.com">International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)</a>
				provides a globally streamlined age classification process for digital products. This process helps provide users with consistent access to established and trusted ratings across digital storefronts and platforms.</p>
			<p>The Epic Games Store welcomes and encourages partners to obtain IARC ratings for the products they distribute on the storefront. Note that some regions, including Australia, Brazil, and Russia,
				<strong>require</strong>
				IARC or region-specific ratings in order to distribute products in those areas.</p>

				<h2 id="grac-ratings">GRAC Ratings</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/english/about/overview.aspx">GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee)</a>
				ratings are legally required to distribute products in South Korea for any playable builds (including demo and early-access builds) that are available to the public.</p>
			<p>To ensure a successful launch in South Korea, allow enough lead time to acquire a GRAC rating for your product before its release. As a general guideline, non-mature (age 15 and under) titles require at least one week of lead time. Mature (age 18+) titles require at least six weeks.</p>
			<p>The process to obtain a GRAC rating varies between non-mature and mature titles. The distinction between these categories follows the
				<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/english/enforcement/ageratingsymbol.aspx">Game Industry Promotion Act (GRAC) guidelines</a>.</p>
			<p>Note that IARC ratings do not grant GRAC certificates on the Epic Games Store. However, the Epic Games Store has a dedicated team available to help you obtain the necessary ratings for distribution in Korea.</p>
