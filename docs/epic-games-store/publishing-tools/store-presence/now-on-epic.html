			<p>The Now On Epic program allows you to bring your previously-released products to the Epic Games Store. If you are eligible and participate, you can boost your net revenue from user spending on eligible products from 88<i>%</i>
				to 100<i>%</i>
				on eligible products in the product's first six months on the store on all payments processed by Epic Games. After the six-month run, your products continue to benefit from Epic’s 88<i>%</i>
				/ 12<i>%</i>
				revenue split.</p>
			<p>Now on Epic is open to developers and publishers on the Epic Games Store for any product released before October 31, 2023 on another third-party PC store or included in a third-party subscription service.</p>
			<p>For more information, visit our
				<a href="http://store.epicgames.com/features/now-on-epic">information page</a>.</p>
