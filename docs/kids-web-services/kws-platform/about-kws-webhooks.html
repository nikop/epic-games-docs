			<p>KWS uses webhooks to notify your system of important service events. This requires some configuration on your side to receive the webhook calls:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, you provide the URL to which KWS will send the webhook call.</li>
				<li>Using the secret code that KWS provides, you need to generate a signature. This is matched against KWS' signature to confirm the webhook call is really coming from KWS.</li>
			</ul>
