			<p>Use EOS Epic Account Services to tap into an ecosystem of over 500 million players across multiple platforms and stores; allow game players to access their friends across a wide variety of supported platforms, regardless of the storefronts a game is available on or the game engines a game is built in.</p>
			<p>EOS Epic Account Services is part of Epic Online Services (EOS). You can find out more about Epic Online Services in the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/services-overview">Epic Online Services (EOS) Overview</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/services-quick-start">EOS Quick Start</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<p>EOS Epic Account Services exposes API operations to
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/auth-interface">authenticate</a>
				players and access their
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/eos-friends-interface">friends</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/eos-presence-interface">presence</a>. They also provide some Epic Games Store services, such as

						<strong>EOS Game Services do not require EOS Epic Account Services</strong>
						<br>
						EOS Epic Account Services are a set of resources which are specific to using cross-platform Epic Games account social features in your game.  If you use EOS Game Services in your game, you do not require EOS Epic Account Services. Players can connect to your game using either an identity from a supported identity provider (such as a Steam account) or an Epic Games account.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Acceptable use</strong>
						<br>
						Acceptable use of EOS Epic Account Services is defined in the Service Addendum for Epic Account Services.
						<br>
						For information on how to set up your application for Epic Account Services, see the documentation:
						<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/getting-started">Getting Started with EOS Epic Account Services</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Preview mode</strong>
						<br>
						EOS Epic Account Services are available in preview mode, and is subject to some temporary limitations. These are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The service does not offer parental consent when players access games from outside of the Epic Games Store.</li>
						<li>Audience restrictions apply for unverified applications.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>OpenID specification compatibility</strong>
						<br>
						The EOS Epic Account Services authentication and authorization flow is compatible with OpenID Connect Core 1.0 and Discovery 1.0 specifications with minor extensions. EOS Epic Account Services OpenID provider configuration is available at
						<a href="https://api.epicgames.dev/epic/oauth/v1/.well-known/openid-configuration">api.epicgames.dev/~/openid-configuration</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Epic Games accounts vs. EOS Organization User IDs / EOS Product User IDs</strong>
						<br>
						There are several commonalities and differences between the Epic Games account system and the EOS Organization/Product User ID system.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Both (a) the Epic Games account system and (b) the EOS Organization User ID / EOS Product User ID system are fully cross-platform, and both support a wide variety of external authentication methods.</li>
						<li>However, in contrast to an ecosystem-wide Epic Games account:
							<!-- -->
							<ul>
								<li>An EOS Organization User ID is always specific to a developer's 
									<!-- -->organization
									<!-- -->.</li>
								<li>An EOS Product User ID is always specific to a 
									<!-- -->product
									<!-- -->.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>As a result:
							<!-- -->
							<ul>
								<li>The same external identity, such as a console 
									<!-- -->account
									<!-- --> is always linked at most to one (a) Epic Games account at a time, but can be linked to multiple (b) EOS Organization User IDs simultaneously, though no more than once per Organization.</li>
								<li>The same EOS Organization User ID can point at most to one EOS Product User ID per each product.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
