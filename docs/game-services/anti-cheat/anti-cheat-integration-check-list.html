				<p>The
					<strong>Anti-Cheat Interfaces</strong>
					require using SDK 1.12 or higher. The Anti-Cheat Client interfaces supports Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, and requires a 64-bit operating system installation.</p>
			</div>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>

				<code>EasyAntiCheat_EOS_Setup.exe qa-factory-reset</code>
				from a command prompt.</p>
			<p>This ensures that your test system is in the same state as the system of a player who has never played any Easy Anti-Cheat protected game before. If you have other Easy Anti-Cheat protected games installed then they will need to be repaired or reinstalled after this operation.</p>
			<p>Success criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The command
					<code>sc query EasyAntiCheat_EOS</code>
					reports that the specified service does not exist as an installed service.</li>
				<li>Registry keys do not exist at the following location:
					<code>HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\EasyAntiCheat_EOS\</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>2. Install the game as a player would, using e.g. the Epic Games Store, Steam, etc.</p>
			<p>Success criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>EasyAntiCheat_EOS_Setup</code>
					executes with Administrator rights, and it closes with exit status
					<code>0</code>.</li>
				<li>The command
					<code>sc query EasyAntiCheat_EOS</code>
					reports that the service exists and is in a
					<code>STOPPED</code>
					state when the game is not running.</li>
			</ul>
