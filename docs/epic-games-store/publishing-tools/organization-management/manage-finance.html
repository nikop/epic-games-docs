			<p>In order to distribute products on the Epic Games Store, you must create a tax profile and activate your payout account. This process may take up to 2 weeks or more to complete as the information provided must undergo verification.</p>
			<p>Setting up your tax profile and payout account is
				<strong>required</strong>. You cannot submit your product for review by the Epic Games Store team until this process is complete.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Ensure the financial information you provide throughout this process reflects the entity type you select. For example, if you select company or business as your entity type, provide the requested information (such as IDs) for your organization rather than personal information.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="create-tax-profile">Create Tax Profile</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To get started, first create your tax profile by following the steps below. You must complete this step before you can activate your payout account.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Organization &gt; Tax Info</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Start Tax Interview section, select the appropriate entity type for your tax profile (e.g., personal, business, etc.). Then, click
					<strong>Start Tax Interview</strong>.</li>
				<li>Follow the prompts to provide the required tax information for your entity type, which may include identity and location information, tax status, and applicable tax forms. On the final step, click
					<strong>Exit Interview</strong>
					to return to your dashboard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After the interview is complete, your tax profile is automatically submitted for verification. Depending on your location, the verification process may take up to 5 days or more. You can monitor the status of your profile at any time by visiting the Tax Info tab.</p>
			<p>When your profile is verified, an email containing next steps is sent to the organization owner, and an overview of your profile displays on the Tax Info tab. You can then proceed to the
				<a href="#activate-payout-account">Activate Payout Account</a>
				process.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Tip</strong>: To update your tax profile after creation, select the Retake Tax Interview button available on the Tax Info tab of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="activate-payout-account">Activate Payout Account</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Once your tax profile has been created, you can activate your payout account through Hyperwallet. To do so, follow the steps below.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Some organizations, such as those based in Turkey, do not need to create a Hyperwallet account. Instead, you will complete an alternate registration process to provide your payout account information. After completing the tax interview, visit the Payout Info tab for details on how to proceed.</p>
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>Ensure a tax profile has been created and verified for your organization.</li>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Organization &gt; Payout Info</strong>
					and click
					<strong>Activate Hyperwallet Account</strong>
					to launch the activation process on the Hyperwallet site.</li>
				<li>Follow the prompts on the Hyperwallet site to create your account. During this process, you will be asked to verify your payee information by supplying identity and/or business registration documentation. This step is required in order to complete the activation.</li>
				<li>On the final step of the Hyperwallet process, click
					<strong>Submit</strong>
					to finalize your account.</li>
			</ol>

						for assistance.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Once the account is finalized, your information is automatically submitted for verification. Depending on your location, the verification process may take up to 7 days or more. You can monitor the status of your account at any time through the Hyperwallet site dashboard.</p>
			<p>Once your information is verified, a confirmation email is sent to the Hyperwallet account owner. Additionally, an overview of your account displays on the Payout Info tab of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Tip</strong>: To update your Hyperwallet account after creation, navigate directly to the Hyperwallet site or select the
				<em>Update Hyperwallet Account</em>
				button available on the Payout Info tab.</p>
