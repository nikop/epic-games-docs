			<p>To improve your conversion rates, the PV service aims to make it as easy as possible for parents to verify their identity and grant permission for their child to use your app. Depending on the child’s location (which you pass to the KWS API), the PV service supports a variety of methods that the parent can use to verify their identity quickly and easily.</p>

				<p>NOTE: You can

			<p>KWS supports the following verification methods:</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="payment-card-worldwide-except-russia-and-belarus">Payment card (worldwide except Russia and Belarus)</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Parents in all regions except Russia and Belarus can verify their identity using a payment (credit or debit) card. The payment card details are verified by
				<a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For parents in the U.S., a charge of $0.05 is made against the card and then refunded to the parent.</li>
				<li>For parents outside the U.S., a small charge in the local currency is authorized but not actually taken from their card. For example, an amount of £0.05 is authorized for parents in the U.K.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For these charges, KWS uses the currency of the parent’s current location, which is determined by GeoIP.</p>
