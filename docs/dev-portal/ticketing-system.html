			<p>Epic Online Services (EOS) provides a ticketing system for you to manage support for users of your products (games or other software applications). The EOS ticketing system, known as "Player Ticketing", provides a centralized location for your user support: it provides an automatically generated, pre-assigned email address and a public web API key.</p>
			<p>You manage the ticketing system in the Player Ticketing page of the Developer Portal. It provides you with the following functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can tracking open, in-progress, and closed tickets.</li>
				<li>You can merging related tickets.</li>
				<li>You can reply to users who have submitted a ticket and want to receive replies.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="set-up-the-ticketing-system-with-your-product">Set Up The Ticketing System With Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To manage player ticketing for your product, go to the your product's Game Services page, scroll down the page and click
				<strong>Player Ticketing</strong>.</p>
			<p>To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your product page:
					<ul>
						<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), from the left navigation, under
							<strong>Your Products</strong>,  click the name of your product. (<strong>Note</strong>: You might have to click
							<strong>Back to organization</strong>
							before you can do this.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once you are in your product page, from the left navigation, click
					<strong>Game Services</strong>.</li>
				<li>Scroll down the left navigation under
					<strong>Game Services</strong>
					and click
					<strong>Player Ticketing</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Integrate APIs</strong>.<br>
					<strong>Note</strong>: The first time you use player ticketing for a product, there is an
					<strong>Integrate APIs</strong>
					button. You must click
					<strong>Integrate APIs</strong>
					before you can use player ticketing with your product. You only need to do this once for a product. After you have clicked it, the Developer Portal replaces it with
					<strong>Show API key</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Show API key</strong>
					and follow the onscreen instructions to view the public web API key for the product.<br>
					You use this key to implement the API. Each product has its own public web API key, but the ticketing system uses the same email address for all your products.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: The Player Ticketing page in the Developer Portal is also where you see your user's support tickets. You use this page to track and manage the tickets.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="how-to-use-the-api">How to Use the API</h2>
			</div>

					<code>https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/api/v1/services/tickets/submit</code>.</li>
				<li>Include your product's API key in the HTTP authorization field and the information that you want to report.</li>
			</ul>
