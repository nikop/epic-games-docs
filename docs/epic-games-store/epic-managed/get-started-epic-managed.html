			<p>This page explains how to set up your product on the Epic Games Store if you are using Epic-managed distribution. Find answers on how to get started, how to publish, and how to update your products.</p>

				<h2 id="how-to-work-with-the-storm-team">How to Work with the STORM Team</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store Operations and Release Management (STORM) team helps partners to release content on the Epic Games Store. The STORM team serves four main functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enable you to onboard, prepare, launch, and manage your products on the Epic Games Store.</li>
				<li>Deliver configuration support and guidance for offer and artifact setups and updates.</li>
				<li>Guide the release process through an aligned launch plan and readiness confirmation.</li>
				<li>Provide information and materials to make publishing a frictionless, efficient experience throughout each step of the release process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A member of the STORM team, your Release Manager, is assigned to your organization. They will be your main point of contact with the team. When you have signed your deal, your product enters the onboarding process and your Release Manager contacts you to guide and support your efforts. Your Release Manager is responsible for the backend configuration of your product setup. After the configuration is completed, the team provides you with the following credentials so you can complete your setup:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organization ID</li>
				<li>Code name</li>
				<li>Product ID</li>
				<li>Sandbox ID</li>
				<li>BuildPatch Tool Client ID and Client Secret</li>
				<li>Staging artifact and live artifact</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The process starts when you sign an agreement to publish a product on the Epic Games Store. Your Release Manager assists your team through the entire release process, from onboarding to launch and beyond. The timeline below shows the high-level steps you can expect. Note that the timeline is an example only, and your publishing journey might vary.</p>
