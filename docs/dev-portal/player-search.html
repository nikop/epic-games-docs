			</div>
			<p>To access the Player Search page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal (dev.epicgames.com/portal), make sure you are in the correct organization relating to your product.<br>
					To do this:
					<ul>
						<li>a) Select Organization from the top of the left navigation’s dropdown menu (in the image above, the organization name is  “Your…”).</li>
						<li>b) Follow the onscreen instructions to choose your organization.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>From the left navigation, click
					<strong>Dashboard</strong>
					to see the Developer Portal home page, and on that page, click
					<strong>Player Search</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On the Player Search page, you can search users through different user ID types. These are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>Product User ID</code>
					- PUID (Glossary:
					<span>
						<span aria-label="tooltip ProductUserId" tabindex="0" role="button">ProductUserId</span>
					</span>)</li>
				<li>
					<code>Player Account ID</code>
					- a unique ID from an external platform, for example, a user's Epic Games account ID or Steam ID.</li>
				<li>
					<code>Epic Account for development</code>
					- an Epic account linked with a console development account.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The search results provide the following data about a user:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Player Profile</li>
				<li>Linked Accounts</li>
				<li>Data Rights</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can export or delete all stored data about a user.</p>

			</div>
			<p>The Linked Accounts tab displays any external accounts a user has linked to their Product User ID using the EOS Connect Interface (documentation:
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-connect-interface">Connect Interface</a>). This information is useful for your organization's user or player support. Use it to resolve user or player issues, such as unlinking an accidentally-linked external account. Here you can also review the full account linking history for a user.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: The Linked Accounts tab can also give options for console-development accounts. For more information, see the
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/player-search#console-development-accounts">Console Development Accounts</a>
				section below.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="unlink-a-users-account">Unlink a User's Account</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Users might want to change which external accounts they have linked through the EOS Connect Interface.  The following are examples of why users might want to do this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The user no longer wants to maintain an account for a particular identity provider.</li>
				<li>The user wants to link a different identity provider account with a different username.</li>
				<li>You have to unlink a user's account with a specific identity provider for security reasons or fraud-prevention measures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To remove a linked account for an identity provider, click
				<strong>Unlink Account</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once you unlink an account, your organization no longer tracks it, and the user can no longer sign in to your products using that identity provider unless they re-link.</li>
				<li>When you unlink an account, it is instantaneous but unlinking does not necessarily remove other linked accounts or remove the user from the EOS service.</li>
				<li>If you unlink an external account from an Epic Games account, and you try to unlink either the last-linked account for a user, or the only linked account for a user, you see a warning. The warning alerts you that you cannot unlink the user's only sign-in method.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="console-development-accounts">Console Development Accounts</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If your product uses
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip Epic Account Services" tabindex="0" role="button">Epic Account Services</span>
				</span>, when you sign up your product for console development with EOS, your console-development account is associated with new console-Epic-Games account. When you search for an Epic Games account using Player Search, the results return the new console-Epic-Games account as well as the console-development accounts associated with it.</p>
			<p>In the Linked Accounts tab, you can delete the console-Epic-Games account. You can use this to test the Epic Games accounts sign-in flow again, re-using the same console-development account.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: When you have a console-Epic-Games account, the following applies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You cannot unlink its console-development account.</li>
				<li>Access to your console-Epic-Games account has restrictions:
					<ul>
						<li>By default, you cannot access the console-Epic-Games account outside of the console device.<br>
							This is because you cannot use the linked console-development account to sign-in outside the console development environment.</li>
						<li>You can amend this as follows:
							<ul>
								<li>When you sign into Epic Games on a web browser using a console-development account, the sign-in prompts you to assign an email and a password to the new console-Epic-Games account.<br>
									After you do this, you can access the console-Epic-Games account outside of the console development environment. This enables you to connect additional external accounts to the console-Epic-Games account.<br>
									<strong>Tip</strong>: Connect accounts in Epic Games's account management website (go to
									<em>your account icon, top right of any page in the Developer Portal</em>
									&gt;
									<strong>Manage Account</strong>
									&gt;
									<strong>Account Settings</strong>
									&gt;
									<strong>APPS AND ACCOUNTS</strong>).</li>
								<li>After you have assigned a username and password to the console-Epic-Games account, you can only unlink the console-Epic-Games account from your console-development account. You cannot delete the console-Epic-Games account itself.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

					<p>The Data Rights tab on the Player Search page.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</div>
			<p>Use the Data Rights tab to export or delete data stored for a user by EOS on your behalf. You can also export and delete user data for a specific product, if a user has used multiple products created by your organization.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You cannot export data while a delete is in progress and you cannot delete data while an export is in progress.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="export-player-data">Export Player Data</h4>
			</div>
			<p>There are two export requests. These are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Export Product Data</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To request a user's player progression and user data for a specific product, click
							<strong>Export Product Data</strong>
							for any product. (Note that this does not include organization data associated with that user ID.)</li>
						<li>This request is linked with the user's Product User ID (PUID) which is unique to each of your products (Glossary:
							<span>
								<span aria-label="tooltip ProductUserId" tabindex="0" role="button">ProductUserId</span>
							</span>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Export All Data</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To request a user's player progression and user data for all products your organization manages, including all data associated with a user ID, click
							<strong>Export All Data</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After you have made either request, EOS emails you, the requester at your organization, a link to a bundle containing the data. This bundle is accessible for 30 days, after which you must make a new request to obtain up-to-date data. You can issue requests to export data for a user once every 10 days. The maximum expected time to process a request is 14 days, though requests are usually processed more quickly.</p>
			<p>The bundle might contain encrypted information. See the following documentation for guidance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/docs/game-services/player-data-storage">Player Data Storage</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/docs/game-services/title-storage">Title Storage</a>

				<li>
					<a href="/docs/game-services/file-decryption-tool">File Decryption Tool</a>
					- for information on how to decrypt data.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="delete-player-data">Delete Player Data</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Some circumstances might require deleting a user's data completely. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You want to permanently remove a user due to a violation.</li>
				<li>A user's account data might become corrupted or compromised.</li>
				<li>A user might specifically request removal of their account data.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are three deletion options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Delete Product Data</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To permanently delete a user's player progression and user data for that product, click
							<strong>Delete Product Data</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Delete User</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To delete a user's data across all products managed by your organization, click
							<strong>Delete User</strong>
							at the top of the page.</li>
						<li>Delete User also unlinks all their accounts for all identity providers and removes any organization data about the user not explicitly associated with any single product. This request  has a 10-day grace period in case the deletion request is canceled. During the grace period, the account remains searchable, but the user won’t be able to sign in through EOS Connect.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Delete Product Data</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To delete a user's player progression data on a single product, click
							<strong>Delete Product Data</strong>.</li>
						<li>Be aware that linked accounts and organization-level data associated with that user are not affected by this delete and remain stored.</li>
