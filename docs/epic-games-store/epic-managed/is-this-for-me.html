			<p>To publish a
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip product" tabindex="0" role="button">product</span>
				</span>
				on Epic Games Store, you generally fall within one of these different categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Epic-Managed</strong>: Our team sets up your product manually. The pages in this section of the Epic Developer Resources Documentation apply to this distribution method.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Self-Managed</strong>: You use tools within the Developer Portal to set up your own product pages, achievements, pricing,
					<span>
						<span aria-label="tooltip offer" tabindex="0" role="button">offer</span>
					</span>, builds, and updates on the Epic Games Store with less dependence on our team. If you do not have Epic-managed distribution for any of your products, this section of the documentation does not apply to you. For assistance with these products, refer to the
					<a href="/docs/en-USdocs/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store</a>
					section of the documentation.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>A mixture</strong>: Your organization might contain both product types.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-i-have-epic-managed-distribution">How do I know if I have Epic-managed distribution?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To quickly identify whether a product is self-managed or Epic-managed, take a look at the left-hand navigation menu in the Developer Portal. If your product is self-managed, you'll see Release Management, Store Settings, Offers, and more. If your product is Epic-managed, you'll see fewer options: Builds, Pages, and Discount Management Tool.</p>
			<p>You can also review the distribution agreement at any time through the Agreements section of the Dev Portal.</p>
