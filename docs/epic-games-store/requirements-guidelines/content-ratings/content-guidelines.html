				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>We have a number of product and storefront content guidelines that apply to your product on the Epic Games Store. During the review of your product prior to launch, the Epic Games Store team evaluates both product and storefront content to ensure the following criteria are met.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="accuracy-and-consistency">Accuracy and Consistency</h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Product content must be accurate and consistent with the product description presented to users on the Product Home page.</li>
				<li>If you are using the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/iarc-ratings">IARC submission process</a>, your rating must be accurate and consistent with the nature of your product. Providing false or misleading information to achieve a different rating is prohibited.</li>
				<li>Using pre-made assets is acceptable as long as your product has some playability or interactive experience. Asset flipping is not allowed.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="rating-authority-compliance">Rating Authority Compliance</h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>If your product is pending or has received a final rating from an applicable ratings authority (e.g., ESRB, PEGI, ClassInd, USK, etc.), your product page content must adhere to any guidelines provided by the applicable rating authority.</li>
				<li>Please review the applicable ratings authority guidelines before publishing content on your product page (see the PEGI, ESRB, and other applicable ratings body websites for guidance).</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="age-considerations">Age Considerations</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The following policies apply to all products distributed on Epic Games Store:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Products with Adults Only ratings cannot be distributed on Epic Games Store.</li>
				<li>The Epic Games Store treats unrated products as having a mature (18+) rating.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, there are policies specific to your rating and the placement of your content:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While products on the Epic Games Store may be designed and rated for mature audiences, all main storefront content must be suitable for general audiences (that would merit a rating of PEGI 12 or ESRB Everyone 10+, or lower).</li>
				<li>While products on the Epic Games Store may be designed and rated for mature audiences, Product Home page content must be suitable for audiences at a teen level (that would merit a rating of PEGI 16 or ESRB Teen) or lower.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The infographic below helps illustrate this using ESRB ratings as an example:</p>

			<div>
				<h2 id="user-reported-content">User-reported Content</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Storefront users can report content on any Product Home page, which is then subject to re-review and removal from the Epic Games Store. We may reach out to partners to remove or adjust their content in order to comply with our policies if any violations are found.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="linked-to-content">Linked-to Content</h2>
			</div>
			<p>If you link to external content from your storefront pages, the linked-to content must be consistent with the content presented in your store presence. Any linked-to content about your product, regardless of where it’s located, is subject to the same content guidelines defined for Epic Games Store pages. In some cases, links may be rejected if the external content seems suspicious, or otherwise puts the privacy or security of users at risk. Apart from your social media account links, all linked content must be to your product or company’s specific top level website domain. Linking to domains that are not owned by you or your company or that redirect to products or services not hosted on domains owned by you or your company (e.g., the domain of a cloud-based application provider, a file-sharing website, a collaborative document service, etc.) is not permitted.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="user-generated-content">User-Generated Content</h2>
			</div>
			<p>User-Generated Content (UGC) within your product is treated as unrated. The Epic Games Store treats unrated content as having a mature rating. It is your responsibility as the developer or publisher of the product to moderate UGC.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="media-asset-policies">Media Asset Policies</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In addition to the Prohibited Content guidelines above, the following policies apply to certain offers in order to help users understand key differences between products.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your key art must include your product logo.</li>
				<li>Image assets for Seasons Passes, Add-ons, Consumables, and Digital Extras must include your product logo.</li>
				<li>For Editions, the word “Edition” must be in the image asset.</li>
			</ul>

			<div>
				<h2 id="product-names-and-urls">Product Names and URLs</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Product URLs affect how users find and search for your product on the Epic Games Store and through external search engines. Review the requirements below to ensure your requested update aligns with our guidelines.</p>
			<p>Note that if a Product URL is changed users will not be automatically redirected from the old URL to the new one. If a user accesses the old URL, such as through a saved bookmark, it will result in an error message.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Product URL must be the same as your product name.</li>
				<li>Your Product URL must be localized in English.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: In some scenarios, your Product URL and Product Name may not match. For example, you may have used a temporary title or codename prior to launch and have now finalized your Product Name. If your Product URL and Product Name do not match, contact us for assistance by
							<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/">creating a private discussion</a>
							on our Developer Support site. Changes may take up to 2 weeks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Your Product Name and Product URL must follow the Epic Games Store
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines#prohibited-content">content guidelines</a>.</li>
				<li>Your Product Name and Product URL cannot include promotional or marketing language.</li>
				<li>Product Name changes should be infrequent and only out of necessity.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="blockchain-policies">Blockchain Policies</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Products that include Blockchain Technology are allowed on the Epic Game Store if you’ve signed the Blockchain Addendum.  You can learn more about restrictions and requirements on our
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/distribution-requirements/blockchain">Blockchain Technology Guidelines</a>
				page.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="digital-rights-management">Digital Rights Management</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store does not require products to include digital rights management. Third-party digital rights management can be implemented at your discretion.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="localization">Localization</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The following policies apply to all products distributed on the Epic Games Store:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The product itself does not need to be localized to English. However, your Product Home, storefront content, and metadata must be provided in English. This includes your product logo.</li>
				<li>For video assets, the audio must be in English, subtitled to English, or exclude audio entirely.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Support for any additional languages is optional. The Epic Games Store currently supports the following languages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>English</li>
				<li>Arabic</li>
				<li>German</li>
				<li>Spanish (Spain)</li>
				<li>Spanish (Latin America)</li>
				<li>French</li>
				<li>Italian</li>
				<li>Japanese</li>
				<li>Korean</li>
				<li>Polish</li>
				<li>Portuguese</li>
				<li>Russian</li>
				<li>Thai</li>
				<li>Turkish</li>
				<li>Simplified Chinese</li>
				<li>Traditional Chinese</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As best practice, we strongly recommend localizing your storefront pages to provide the best experience for players globally.</p>
			<p>To reduce localization lead-time, consider supporting some popular languages at the time of launch, with additional language support added in the future Some recommended languages to support at launch include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>English</li>
				<li>German</li>
				<li>French</li>
				<li>Spanish</li>
				<li>Russian</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you need localization assistance, we can help! To learn more, review

				<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Content that does not conform to these guidelines may be subject to re-review and/or removal from the Epic Games Store. When reviewing content, we may look at a variety of factors, including the severity of the issue and whether you’re a repeat offender. Action taken can be anything from removing content, a warning, all the way up to a permanent account ban for more severe offenses.</p>
