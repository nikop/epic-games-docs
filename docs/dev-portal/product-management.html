			<p>Products are games or other software projects that contain sandboxes and deployments within EOS. You can have multiple products registered with EOS, and  each
				<span>

				maintains a separate set of sandboxes. At every product creation, a new public
				<span>

				</span>
				is automatically assigned to your live environment.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>

			<p>In your Developer Portal, you can create and manage each of your products from the side panel under
				<strong>Your Products</strong>. The
				<strong>Product Settings</strong>
				are found in the side panel of the specific product you select. Each product has their own set of product settings.</p>
			<p>The default tab provides general information about your product:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>
							<strong>Setting</strong>
						</th>
						<th>
							<strong>Description</strong>
						</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Product ID</td>
						<td>The unique identifier assigned to your product at creation. It cannot be changed once it is assigned.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Product Name</td>
						<td>The display name of your product. You can change it by typing a new name in the field and clicking
							<strong>Change Name</strong>. (You can change your product name at any time, but the original URL will not change.)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Product URL</td>
						<td>The short name for your product helps you quickly identify your product, in addition to the Product ID. The URL is automatically generated by the
							<strong>original Product Name</strong>
							and can only be changed by the SD team in special cases.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Product Cover Image</td>
						<td>A cover image that displays when viewing the product’s page. You can change this by uploading a new image and clicking the
							<strong>Save Image</strong>
							button.</td>
					</tr>

						<td>SDK Credentials</td>
						<td>A list of all your SDK credentials for that product. Do not share this information outside your organization.</td>

				<h3 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Sandboxes are high-level distribution environments for a product that contains store-related information, mod configurations, and entries for specific deployments of the product. For each sandbox, you can configure its
				<a href="#deployments">Deployments</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management">Identity Providers</a>.</p>
			<p>By default, new EOS products include one public, predefined sandbox called
				<em>Live</em>.</p>
			<p>EOS products that integrate with the Epic Games Store have three predefined sandboxes:
				<em>Live</em>,
				<em>Stage</em>, and
				<em>Dev</em>. By default,
				<em>Live</em>
				is a public sandbox, and
				<em>Stage</em>
				and
				<em>Dev</em>
				sandboxes are private.</p>
			<p>To get access to the private
				<em>Stage</em>
				and
				<em>Dev</em>
				sandboxes, you must complete the Epic Games Store onboarding process. To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sign in to the Developer Portal at
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">https://dev.epicgames.com</a>,</li>
				<li>Select your product from the left-side menu and go to
					<strong>Epic Games Store</strong>.</li>
				<li>Follow the instructions in the dialog that appears to complete the onboarding process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can use
				<a href="#player-groups">Player Groups</a>
				to grant external user access to your private sandboxes and deployments without having to add these users as Dev Portal organization members.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="deployments">Deployments</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Deployments are specific distributions of a product and store’s progression, achievements, statistics, matchmaking, and other gameplay-related user information. You can configure your deployments by clicking
				<strong>Deployments</strong>
				for a sandbox. Each
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip deployment" tabindex="0" role="button">deployment</span>
				</span>
				can only attach to a single sandbox. If you want parallel deployments in two different sandboxes, you must create one deployment for each.</p>
			<p>The
				<strong>Deployments</strong>
				modal allows you to create, edit, or archive the deployments of a specific sandbox.</p>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>
				<div>
					<p>Archiving a deployment cannot be undone.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>At creation, each deployment is automatically assigned a unique identifier. This Deployment ID is required for
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface#platform-interface">initializing the SDK</a>
				and is configured to access product session data for that deployment. Information stored at the sandbox level is also obtained by the deployment ID.</p>
			<p>You can associate a deployment with a specific build of your product. To do this, set a deployment ID on the
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip artifact" tabindex="0" role="button">artifact</span>
				</span>
				associated with that build. For information, see
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-artifacts">Manage Artifacts: Select Deployment ID</a>.</p>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>
				<div>
					<p>When launching your product through the Epic Games Launcher, you need to map your deployments to your Epic Games Store

							<em>Live</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>(With wipe) Create two deployments:

				<h5 id="single-branch-beta-test-deployment">Single-Branch Beta Test Deployment</h5>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Create two deployments:
						<em>Dev</em>
						and

						deployment, and run the beta tests in the
						<em>Live</em>
						deployment. Then, ship the game using the
						<em>Live</em>
						deployment.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All data from development and internal testing persists in

				<li>
					<p>(With wipe) Create three deployments:

			<div>
				<h3 id="player-groups">Player Groups</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Player Groups</strong>
				allow you to manage external users’ access to private
				<a href="#sandboxes">sandboxes</a>
				and
				<a href="#deployments">deployments</a>. By default, private sandbox or deployment access is denied to external users unless they are given permission by using Player Groups. For example, you can add your QA team’s
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip account" tabindex="0" role="button">account</span>
				</span>
				ID to a group so they can test on their own private version of your product. If you are using Epic Account Services, access is denied to external users until your application has gone through our
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review/brand-review-process">Brand Review Application Process</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				Access to a private sandbox or deployment is automatically granted to organization users that have access to the associated product.</p>
			<p>You can view and manage external user access to private sandboxes and deployments within the
				<strong>Developer Portal</strong>
				by selecting the
				<strong>Player Groups</strong>
				tab on the
				<strong>Product Settings</strong>
				dashboard.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="creating-a-new-player-group">Creating a New Player Group</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To create a new Player Group, click
				<strong>Create New Group</strong>. Each group you create requires the list of external account IDs you want to grant access. These account IDs can belong to any supported
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management">identity provider</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also import your list of account IDs with a .CSV file. This can be more efficient if you have many IDs from multiple providers.</p>
			<p>To streamline importing multiple IDs, you can download a template with the correct file format from the Import list tab. Here is a sample import list of player IDs:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>Once you finish assigning player groups to the appropriate IDs, select the sandboxes and deployments this group can access. Once you create the group, all external users in that Player Group can access the select private sandboxes and deployments.</p>
			<p>You can always edit a
				<strong>Player Group</strong>
				from the Player Groups tab by selecting the
				<strong>More Options</strong>.</p>
