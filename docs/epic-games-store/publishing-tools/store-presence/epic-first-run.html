			<p>The Epic First Run program is an opt-in exclusivity program for third-party developers on the Epic Games Store. If you are eligible and participate, you can boost your net revenue from user spending on eligible products from 88<i>%</i>
				to 100<i>%</i>
				in your first six months on the Epic Games Store. After the six-month run, you will continue to benefit from Epic’s 88<i>%</i>
				/ 12<i>%</i>
				revenue split.</p>
			<p>Participating products in the Epic First Run program are presented to users on-store with new exclusive badging, homepage placements, and dedicated collections (note that the exclusive badging will not be available immediately when Epic First Run launches). We will feature your products in relevant store campaigns, including sales, events, and editorial as applicable. A product benefits from continued exposure while it is in the Epic First Run Program.</p>
			<p>The program allows developers of any scale to activate our global audience right at launch.</p>
			<p>To get the greatest benefit from this program, you must promote your products early and often with your target audience. See our
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/best-practicefor-store-presence">marketing tips</a>
				found in our
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs">Developer Resources Documentation</a>
				to learn more about publishing best practices.</p>
			<p>The Epic First Run program is open to developers and publishers on the Epic Games Store, with eligible new releases launching on or after October 16, 2023. For more information, visit our
				<a href="http://store.epicgames.com/features/epic-first-run-program">information page</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have already released your product on another third-party PC store, or included it in a subscription service available on another third-party PC store, then you cannot include it in Epic First Run. However, you might be eligible to get similar benefits from the
