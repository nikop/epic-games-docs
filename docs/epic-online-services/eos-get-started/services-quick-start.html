			<p>To get up and running with the Epic Online Services (EOS), integrate the EOS SDK with your game, so your game can access EOS services. To do this, you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up an Epic Games account and organization in the Developer Portal.</li>
				<li>Download the EOS SDK (available in C and C#).</li>
				<li>Integrate the Platform Interface into your game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This document gives guidance on how to do this together with information on the SDK download.</p>
			<p>There are also introduction resources, including introduction blogs, FAQs, and some information on the EOS game engine plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity. For more information on these see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/get-started-resources">Get Started Resources</a>
				page.</p>

				<h2 id="get-started-steps">Get Started Steps</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="before-you-begin---system-requirements">Before You Begin - System Requirements</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Check the following requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The system requirements for your development environment and your game-client's runtime environment in the
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/system-requirements">System Requirements</a>
					page.</li>
				<li>A list of the host addresses that you need to access to use EOS SDK in the
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/firewall-considerations">Firewall Considerations</a>
					page.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-1---set-up-an-epic-games-account-and-organization">Step 1 - Set up an Epic Games Account and Organization</h3>
			</div>
			<p>You use the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>) to set up your game to use EOS services, to configure the services, and to access the SDK download.</p>
			<p>In the Developer Portal, you associate your Epic Games account with an "organization", which is your company or business. Each game is known as a "product". An organization can have multiple products.</p>
			<p>Every game (<strong>product</strong>
				in the Developer Portal) has:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>A product ID</strong>
					- a unique identifier for your game.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>One or more sandbox IDs</strong>
					- different named environments for your game's implementation. Example use: you have three different sandboxes to separate the development, testing, and production versions of a game's implementation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every sandbox has:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>One or more deployment IDs</strong>
					- different iterations of your game's implementation within a sandbox. Example use: every deployment in your testing sandbox is either a beta test version or a release candidate, and every deployment in your production sandbox is a release version.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The EOS SDK uses these to identify your game with the EOS services.</p>
			<p>For more information about how to use product management tools when setting up an account, see the documentation on
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/product-management">Product, Sandbox, and Deployment IDs</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-2---download-the-eos-sdk">Step 2 - Download the EOS SDK</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Your game uses the EOS SDK to access EOS services. You integrate EOS services with your game through interfaces. These interfaces are SDK APIs and Web APIs. To integrate EOS services, you must call these APIs in your game’s code.</p>
			<p>Once you have set up your organization and products in the Developer Portal, you can download the EOS SDK from the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>To get the EOS SDK download, on the Developer Portal home page, click
				<strong>Download SDK</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				To use Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK, your local network, router, and firewall must allow access to specific host addresses. For a complete list of these host addresses, see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/firewall-considerations">Firewall Considerations</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="eos-sdk-download-types">EOS SDK Download Types</h4>
			</div>
			<p>There are different types of SDK downloads to use, depending on which platform your game client runs on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Windows, macOS, Linux</strong>
					- the EOS SDK in C, and the EOS SDK in C#.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Mobile</strong>
					- the EOS SDK for iOS, and the EOS SDK for Android.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Consoles</strong>
					- there are EOS SDK downloads for game consoles in C, and in C#.
					<br>
					The SDK downloads for consoles are only available to developers approved by the platform holders and approved by Epic Games.
					<br>
					The platform holders are: Microsoft (Xbox One, Xbox Series X), Sony (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), and Nintendo (Switch).</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="access-to-the-sdk-for-consoles">Access to the SDK for Consoles</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To get access to the SDK downloads for consoles and associated documentation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to the Developer Portal at
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>, click
					<strong>SDK &amp; RELEASE NOTES</strong>, and click
					<strong>Request access</strong>
					at the bottom for guidance on applying for console developer access from the platform holders.</li>
				<li>Once you have platform-holder approval, you can apply to Epic Games using the
					<em>Console Developer Request for Epic Online Services</em>
					form, which is at
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/console-access-request">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="whats-in-the-eos-sdk-download">What's in the EOS SDK Download</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The EOS SDK download has the following directories:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Directory</strong>
						</td>
						<td colspan="3">
							<strong>Content</strong>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>/Samples</code>
						</td>
						<td colspan="3">Sample projects implementations demonstrating how the EOS SDK works.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>/SDK</code>
						</td>
						<td colspan="3">The libraries and header files you use in your game code to integrate the EOS SDK with your game so your game can use EOS services.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>/ThirdPartyNotices</code>
						</td>
						<td colspan="3">Legal information about supporting libraries.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<div>
				<h3 id="step-3---integrate-the-platform-interface">Step 3 - Integrate the Platform Interface</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To use any EOS services, you must first integrate the Platform Interface into your game.</p>
			<p>The Platform Interface does not provide a service, instead it facilitates your game’s integration with all other EOS services. EOS requires the Platform Interface as the first parameter to every API call that uses an interface.</p>
			<p>For full guidance, see the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Platform Interface is an EOS Game Services interface. However both EOS Game Services and EOS Epic Account Services require the Platform Interface.</li>
				<li>The Platform Interface is not related to the games platforms your game clients run on.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h4>
			</div>
			<p>For an overview of the functionality provided by each interface, see the following documentation:</p>
