				<!-- -->product
				<!-- --> release. It’s how you build awareness among potential customers and ensure that your product stands out in a crowd. Every product is unique and deserves its own marketing plan, but here are a few general best practices that can help you get started.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Start spreading awareness of your product early by launching your Coming Soon page at the same time you announce your product. Don’t wait until your product is available for purchase. Roll out your presence on the storefront at the same time as your announcement so that users know your product will be available on the Epic Games Store.</p>
