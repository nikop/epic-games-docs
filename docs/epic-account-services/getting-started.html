			<p>EOS Epic Account Services is a set of resources that is specific to using Epic Games accounts in your game (or other software product).</p>
			<p>EOS Epic Account Services is part of Epic Online Services (EOS). EOS consists of two sets of resources: EOS Epic Game Services, and EOS Epic Account Services. See the following documentation to find out more:
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/eos-introduction">EOS Introduction</a>

				<h2 id="when-to-use-eos-epic-account-services">When to Use EOS Epic Account Services</h2>
			</div>
			<p>If you use only EOS Game Services in your game, you do not require EOS Epic Account Services. You only need to use EOS Epic Account Services if you want your players to connect to your game using their Epic Games accounts so they can use services such as crossplay, friends, player presence, and the social overlay.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>EOS Game Services</strong>
				<br>
				When you connect players to your game using EOS Game Services, note the following points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Players can connect to your game using either an identity from a supported identity provider (such as a Steam account, or other supported identity provider) or an Epic Games account.</li>
				<li>You use the Game Services Connect Interface to connect players through a supported identity provider.</li>
			</ul>

				<strong>EOS Epic Account Services</strong>
				<br>
				When you connect players to your game using EOS Epic Account Services, note the following points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Players can connect to your game using Epic Games accounts.</li>
				<li>Players can use a set of resources that are specific to Epic Games accounts, such as crossplay, friends, player presence, and the social overlay.</li>
				<li>You use the Epic Account Services Auth Interface to connect players through Epic Games accounts.</li>

				<strong>Sign Up or Sign In to an Epic Games Account in the Developer Portal</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Before you can begin setting up EOS Epic Account Services with your game, you must sign in to your Epic Games account in the Developer Portal and set up an organization.</p>
			<p>If you don’t have an Epic Games account already, you can sign up through the Developer Portal.  This is an Epic Games account and organization for you to manage EOS services with your game. You also have the option to manage your game on the Epic Games Store through the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>How to Sign Up or Sign In</strong>
			</p>
			<p>If you have not already signed-up or signed-in on the Developer Portal, follow
				<em>Step 1 - Set up an Epic Games Account and Organization</em>
				in the following documentation: EOS
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/services-quick-start#get-started-steps">Get Started Steps</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="get-started-overview">Get Started Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>There are two parts to get started with Epic Account Services: first you must follow an admin process, and then you can integrate Epic Account Services with your game.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Part 1: Admin Process</strong>
				<br>
				Once you have set up an Epic Games account and an organization in the Developer Portal, you can start the Epic Account Services admin process. The section below describes how to do this step-by-step.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Part 2: Integrate Epic Account Services with Your Game</strong>
				<br>
				Once you have completed the admin process, you do the following actions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Integrate Epic Account Services into your game using the EOS SDK.
					<br>
					For guidance on accessing and working with the EOS SDK, follow
					<em>Step 2 - Download the EOS SDK</em>
					onwards in the following documentation: EOS
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/services-quick-start#get-started-steps">Get Started Steps</a>.</li>
				<li>When you are familiar with the EOS SDK, you can integrate Epic Account Services with your game. This page describes how to authenticate players with Epic Games accounts (known as "Epic Games users") so they can use Epic Account Services in your game.</li>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="1-add-your-game-to-your-organization">1. Add Your Game to Your Organization</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If you have not done this already, add the game you want to use EOS Epic Account Services to your organization in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Your game is known as your “product” in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), at the top of the left navigation, select your organization name.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>+ Create Product</strong>.</li>
				<li>Enter the name of your product (game or other software application), and click
					<strong>Create</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h4 id="2-accept-the-eos-epic-account-services-legal-agreement">2. Accept the EOS Epic Account Services Legal Agreement</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To accept your game’s EOS Epic Account Services legal agreement, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), in the top left navigation, click your product’s name. This display’s your product’s page.</li>
				<li>From the left-hand menu, click
					<strong>Epic Account Services</strong>. This displays the Epic Account Services dashboard.</li>
				<li>Review and accept a Service Addendum for Epic Account Services. (If you have already accepted it, it doesn't display again.) To accept the agreement, scroll down to the bottom of the left pane, and then click
					<strong>Accept</strong>
					on the right pane.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h5 id="agreement-types">Agreement Types</h5>
			</div>
			<p>There is a key difference between the EOS Game Services agreement and the EOS Epic Account Services agreement.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>EOS Game Services agreement:
					<ul>
						<li>You license Epic Games as a service provider to process your player data on your behalf. There is no agreement between your players and Epic Games.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Service Addendum for Epic Account Services:
					<ul>
						<li>Epic Games manages player data on your players' behalf, with their consent. There is an agreement between your players and Epic Games.</li>
						<li>You agree to use the player data for permitted uses only, as defined in the Service Addendum for Epic Account Services.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h5 id="how-to-review-agreements">How to Review Agreements</h5>
			</div>
			<p>You can review the agreements you have already accepted in the Developer Portal from the Organization page.
				<br>
				To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the Developer Portal Organization page. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>

				<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy">www.epicgames.com/~/privacypolicy</a>.)</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="accept-the-agreement-more-than-once">Accept the Agreement More Than Once</h5>
			</div>
			<p>Depending on your organization, you might need to accept each agreement more than once:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organizations that are company entities only need to accept each agreement once.</li>
				<li>Organizations that are individual entities require each member of the organization with access to the Epic Account Services dashboard to accept each agreement.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="3-register-your-product-with-eos-epic-account-services">3. Register Your Product with EOS Epic Account Services</h4>
			</div>
			<p>You register your product for Epic Account Services in the Epic Account Services page of the Developer Portal.</p>

				<p>The Permissions tab in the Developer Portal. |Click image to enlarge.|</p>
			</div>
			<p>In the Permissions tab, you define the level of access your game requests from Epic Games users.</p>
			<p>Epic Account Services has three levels of permissions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Basic Profile:</strong>
					Allows read access to user display names, language preferences, and linked-account display names.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Online Presence:</strong>
					Allows your product to set the online presence of a user and to receive online presence updates from their friends.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Friends:</strong>
					Allows read access to the friends list for a user’s account.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>:
				<strong>Basic Profile</strong>
				is always required for Epic Account Services. You cannot deactivate it because your product cannot access  any user data without it.</p>
			<p>You can enable or disable
				<strong>Online Presence</strong>
				and
				<strong>Friends</strong>, depending on the requirements of your product.</p>
			<p>To set the permission level:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Toggle on the permissions you want to enable for your application.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
				<li>The consent dialog preview on the left side of the tab updates to reflect the permissions you add or remove.</li>

				<p>The Linked Clients tab in the Developer Portal |Click image to enlarge.|</p>
			</div>
			<p>In the Linked Clients clients tab, you choose clients to link to your Epic Account Services application from a list of clients you have already associated with your product.</p>
			<p>If you have not already associated clients with your product, you can follow a link from this tab to do this.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>About Clients</strong>
				<br>
				A client is any software program that accesses EOS services for your product. A client can be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Game clients used by players on their local devices to play your game.</li>
						<li>Software clients used by software users on their local devices to run your software application.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Trusted servers as clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Your product might use non-EOS services that are complementary to EOS services. These non-EOS services are known as “trusted servers”. Trusted servers require access to your product's user data, so you must add them as a "client".</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Any other use for a client you choose.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You must associate a client with client policies: client policies are the necessary permissions for a client.</p>
			<p>For further information, see the documentation: Developer Portal -
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/client-credentials">Client Credential and Client Policy Management</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>About Linked Clients</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linked clients are clients you have already associated with your product that you wish to add to your Epic Account Services application.
					<br>
					You manage clients in the Clients tab of the Product Settings page. (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>
					menu: /<code>your organization name</code>/ &gt;
					<strong>Products</strong>: /<code>your product name</code>/ &gt;
					<strong>Product Settings
						<strong>&gt;</strong>
						Clients</strong>.)** **</li>
				<li>The linked clients that you add to an application share the same user permissions (consent) once a user gives consent.</li>
				<li>You can add as many linked clients to an application as you choose but you can only add them one at a time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>How to Link Clients</strong>
				<br>
				<strong>Note</strong>: In this Developer Portal,  "Application Clients" and "Linked Clients" mean the same thing.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>If you already have clients associated with your product, you can select them from the
					<strong>Select Clients</strong>
					dropdown.</li>
				<li>If not, click
					<strong>add Client</strong>
					to open your product’s Product Settings page and configure a new client.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For details on how to add new clients, see the
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/client-credentials">Client Credential and Client Policy Management</a>
				page.</p>
			<p>Once you have added a linked client to the application, click
				<strong>Save</strong>
				to save your changes.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Once you have completed the fields in the three admin tabs, you have completed the admin process. You are ready to integrate Epic Account Services into your game.</p>
			<p>When your brand settings have passed the brand review process, Epic Games removes audience restrictions, and you can make your game visible to Epic Games users outside of your organization.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="integrate-epic-account-services-with-your-game">Integrate Epic Account Services with your Game</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Once you have completed the admin process described above, there is no additional setup to use Epic Account Services. You use the EOS SDK with Epic Account Services in the same way that you use the EOS SDK with Game Services. However, with Epic Account Services, you must set up authentication for players using Epic Games accounts (these players are known as "Epic Games users").</p>
			<p>If you are authenticating through the EOS SDK, you must use the Auth Interface.  You cannot use the Connect Interface: the Connect Interface is only for Game Services.</p>
			<p>The following sections give guidance on authenticating Epic Games users, so they can use Epic Account Services in your game.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="authenticate-with-the-eos-sdk">Authenticate With the EOS SDK</h4>
			</div>
			<p>You must do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use a login type appropriate for your target platform. (See documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/auth/auth-interface">Auth Interface</a>.)</li>
				<li>Remember to include the scopes you want the Epic Games user to consent to in the login call that you denoted during your brand review  (their profile,
					<span role="tooltip" aria-label="presence">
						<span tabindex="0">presence</span>
					</span>, and friends list). (See documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review">Brand Review</a>.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For example, to login via the account portal on a PC, your login call may appear as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>EOS_Auth_Credentials Credentials = { 0 };Credentials.ApiVersion = EOS_AUTH_CREDENTIALS_API_LATEST;Credentials.Type = EOS_LCT_AccountPortal; EOS_Auth_LoginOptions LoginOptions = { 0 };LoginOptions.ApiVersion = EOS_AUTH_LOGIN_API_LATEST;LoginOptions.ScopeFlags = EOS_AS_BasicProfile | EOS_AS_FriendsList | EOS_AS_Presence;LoginOptions.Credentials = &amp;Credentials; EOS_Auth_Login(AuthHandle, &amp;LoginOptions, NULL, OnLoginCallback);</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>This opens a default system web browser that prompts the Epic Games account user to login and review the game's access requests.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="authenticate-on-a-web-site">Authenticate on a Web Site</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To authenticate Epic Games users on websites and web applications, EOS supports the authorization code flow for OpenID Connect Core 1.0 (see
				<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">openid.net</a>).</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Before you begin, you must go through brand review, set up user permissions, and set up linked clients, as described above in the
				<a href="#get-started-admin-process">Admin Process</a>
				section of this page.)</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="user-authorization">User Authorization</h5>
			</div>
			<p>To initiate the authentication flow, your game must redirect the Epic Games user to the authorization page where they log in to their Epic Games account.</p>
			<p>Redirect your Epic Games users to this authorization URL:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>https://www.epicgames.com/id/authorize?client_id={client_id}&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=basic_profile&amp;redirect_uri=https://www.example.com&amp;state=rfGWJux2WL86Zxr6nKApCAnDo8KexEUE</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>To request additional permissions, modify the scope parameter in the authorization request with a space-delimited list of the required permissions. For example,
				<code>scope=basic_profile friends_list</code>.</p>
			<p>You then need to configure the redirect URL for the client in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>When a user logs in, they are asked to approve the requested permissions. After accepting, they are redirected back to your application with a
				<code>code</code>
				parameter. This code is used when requesting an access token.</p>
			<p>EOS also supports an
				<em>optional</em>
				<code>state</code>
				parameter that you can use to maintain state between the request and the callback. This can prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.</p>
			<p>The following is an example redirect URL after a user is authenticated:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>https://www.example.com/?code=cfd1de1a8d224203b0445fe977838d81&amp;state=rfGWJux2WL86Zxr6nKApCAnDo8KexEUE</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5 id="request-an-access-token">Request an Access Token</h5>
			</div>
			<p>To request an access token, the client makes a request to the token endpoint, including the client credentials and authorization code. The Epic Games token endpoint is
				<code>https://api.epicgames.dev/epic/oauth/v1/token</code>.</p>
			<p>The client credentials pass in the
				<code>Authorization</code>
				header using basic authorization. (Documentation:
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/auth/auth-interface">Auth Interface</a>.)</p>
			<p>In the request, you also need to specify the
				<code>authorization_code</code>
				grant type and include the code and redirect URL from the user authorization flow, described above. (See the section in this page:
				<a href="#user-authorization">User Authorization</a>.)</p>
			<p>The following snippet shows a sample request (using password grant type):</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>POST /epic/oauth/v2/token HTTP/1.1Host: api.epicgames.devContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedAuthorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcg==</pre>
