			<p>Website domain verification is part of the brand review process. See the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review">Brand Review Process</a>
				documentation for further information.</p>
			<p>Brand review and website domain verification link the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your game (or software application), known as “product” in domain verification.</li>
				<li>Your brand</li>
				<li>Your Epic Games Store storefront presence</li>
				<li>Any other associated web links</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This assists with brand cohesion and mitigates against malicious activities, such as brand spoofing, copyright infringement, malware, and stolen identities.</p>
			<p>Before proceeding with the brand review process, Epic Games must verify the veracity of your website domain and privacy policy.</p>
			<p>The domain verification steps are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Automated verification: You add a website domain to your organization in the Developer Portal.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Ownership verification: You verify ownership of your website domain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Manual verification: An Epic Games moderator manually verifies the website domain.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

				<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

			<div>
				<h3 id="step-1-add-domain-and-get-automated-verification">Step 1: Add Domain and Get Automated Verification</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Add a website address ("domain") to your organization and verify ownership. To do this:</p>
			<p>To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the Developer Portal at
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/en-US/">dev.epicgames.com</a>.</li>
				<li>Select your organization name from the top of the left navigation’s dropdown menu.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					to see your Organization page.</li>
				<li>Select the
					<strong>Settings</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>Scroll down the page to
					<strong>Domains</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Add Domain</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If the domain you add passes the automatic verification, the Developer Portal moves onto the next step and displays the
				<strong>Verify ownership</strong>
				pane.</p>
			<p>If the domain fails automatic verification, the Developer Portal does not move onto the next step and the domain is not added to your organization.</p>
			<p>This automated verification process ensures that your domain resolves and is not blocked by any deny-list.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-2-ownership-verification">Step 2: Ownership Verification</h3>
			</div>
			<p>After your domain passes the automated verification, you must verify ownership of the domain.</p>
			<p>To verify ownership, Epic Online Services (EOS) provides a unique
				<code>TXT Domain Secret</code>
				that you manually add to your domain host DNS records. EOS confirms your domain ownership when the
				<code>TXT Domain Secret</code>
				becomes visible.</p>
			<p>Follow the steps below to add the
				<code>TXT Domain Secret</code>
				to your domain host DNS records:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>In the Developer Portal's
						<strong>Verify ownership</strong>
						pane, copy the starred out text in the
						<strong>Domain Secret</strong>
						field</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Go to your domain host account administration access.<br>
						<strong>Note</strong>: The management of your domain host account depends on your domain host provider and is beyond the scope of this page. Contact your website domain host provider for assistance.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In your domain host account, do the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Find your domain’s DNS records and select the option to add a new record (it might be slightly different text to “add a new record”).</li>
						<li>Select the
							<strong>TXT record</strong>
							type.<br>
							<strong>Note</strong>: If your domain host account doesn't support
							<code>TXT record</code>, (for example it uses
							<code>CNAME</code>), contact Epic Games support. See the
							<a href="/docs/support">Support</a>
							page for details.</li>
						<li>In the appropriate field, paste your
							<code>TXT Domain Secret</code>. This field might be known as
							<strong>Value</strong>,
							<strong>Answer</strong>,
							<strong>Destination</strong>, or some other name.</li>
						<li>Save the record on the domain host account. A
							<code>TXT Domain Secret</code>
							verification record does not affect your website or DNS settings.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>In the Developer Portal's Verify ownership pane, click
						<strong>Check txt record</strong>.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Successful Ownership Verification</strong>: When your domain’s ownership verification is successfully completed, the Developer Portal Organization page’s Settings tab displays Verified below the domain name list.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Failed Ownership Verification</strong>: When your domain’s ownership verification fails, contact Epic Games support. See the
				<a href="/docs/support">Support</a>
				page for details.</p>
			<p>When you have successfully completed both the automated verification step and the ownership verification step, you can use the domain in your brand review, including any links you provide for your privacy policy.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-3--manual-verification">Step 3:  Manual Verification</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Epic Games does this step during your product’s brand review. An Epic Games moderator manually checks the domain name as well as the hosted content to validate that it does not contain anything offensive, explicit, or violate any intellectual property rights.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games moderator can provide feedback at any step of verification. If your domain fails verification, Epic Games notifies you with an explanation of the issues to remedy for successful verification when you resubmit your domain for verification.</p>
