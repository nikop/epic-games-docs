			<p>When a parent successfully verifies their identity using the PV service, KWS can notify your app or service by redirecting them to a URL (of your choice) with a 'verification response'.</p>
			<p>The verification response will contain the verification status of the parent alongside a signature that you use to confirm the payload’s authenticity.</p>
			<p>We recommend you use the verification response
				<strong>in addition</strong>
				to the
				<a href="/docs/kids-web-services/set-up-pv-service/config-pv-webhook">‘parent-verified’</a>
				webhook. Both contain the same information (parent verification status), but using both provides redundancy in case one fails to reach your app or service for any reason.</p>
			<p>To receive verification responses, you must make the following updates to the PV service settings for each product:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#provide-a-redirect-url">Set up a redirect URL</a>
					that the service will use for callbacks.</li>
				<li>Use the
					<strong>
						<a href="#use-the-secret-code-to-verify-the-payload-signature">Verification Response secret code</a>
					</strong>, which is shown in the service settings, to generate your own copy of the payload signature to confirm its authenticity. If the signatures match, the payload is genuine.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<p>NOTE: Your Test and Production environments use different Verification Response secret codes.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="provide-a-redirect-url">Provide a redirect URL</h2>
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in to the
					<a href="/docs/kids-web-services/kws-platform/about-kws-dev-portal">KWS Developer Portal</a>.</li>
				<li>Select the
					<strong>Product</strong>
					you want to configure (in the
					<strong>Dashboard</strong>).</li>
				<li>Click the
					<strong>Services</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>View or Edit</strong>
					in the
					<strong>Parent Verification</strong>
					panel.</li>
				<li>The settings for your product are then displayed. Enter the
					<strong>redirect URL</strong>. The redirect URL is where the service will redirect a user to after a successful verification.
					<div>
						<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Do not include sensitive information in the redirect URL that an attacker might use (for example, numeric IDs that may be iterated over easily).</li>
							<li>Do not include special characters in your URL.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Publish to Test</strong>.</li>
			</ol>

				<h2 id="use-the-secret-code-to-verify-the-payload-signature">Use the secret code to verify the payload signature</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When you activate the PV service, the
				<strong>Verification Response secret code</strong>
				is displayed in your product's integration details in the Parent Verification service settings:</p>
			<div tabindex="0" aria-label="Secret code image, press Enter to open full size">
				<div>
					<span>
						<img alt="Secret code" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill">
						<noscript></noscript>
					</span>
				</div>

				</figcaption>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: In the image above, the verification response secret code is intentionally blank, but your code will be displayed.</p>
			<p>When KWS redirects to the redirect URL you provided, it will attach a query with a common structure wrapping the event-specific payload:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>GET https://www.yourdomain.com/your-redirect-url?status=%7B%22verified%22%3Atrue%2C%22transactionId%22%3A%22&lt;transactionId&gt;%22%2C%22errorCode%22%3Anull%7D&amp;externalPayload=&lt;payload&gt;&amp;signature=&lt;signature&gt;</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>The payload signature is generated via HMAC_SHA256 using the status and payload values in the query and the Verification Response secret code displayed in your product’s integration details in the Parent Verification service settings.</p>
			<p>On your app or service’s side, you need to generate a matching signature using the algorithm shown below from the status, payload, and
				<strong>Verification Response secret code</strong>. If the signature you created matches the v1 signature that was passed to you in the query, you can confirm that the redirection was sent by KWS.</p>
			<div>
				<p>NOTE: Both status and payload must be used as raw strings exactly as they are sent in the query. Do not parse and re-stringify the JSON as this may result in mismatched signatures due to inconsistencies in JSON library implementations.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="query-structure">Query structure</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>{  "status": "JSON string containing properties such as verified, transactionId and errorCode",  "payload": "Your payload",  "signature": "Signature generated by KWS",}</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="signatures">Signatures</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Signatures are a HMAC_SHA256 hash in hex format (lowercase), where the secret key is the
				<strong>Verification Response secret code</strong>
				provided in the
				<strong>Parent Verification service</strong>
				settings. Signature key rotation is not currently supported.</p>
			<p>The algorithm to generate v1 signatures is a HMAC_SHA256 of the status included in the query, followed by a colon (':'), followed by the payload included in the query. Initialize the HMAC with your Verification Response secret code.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>const status = /* status from the query as UTF-8 string */;const payload = /* payload from the query as UTF-8 string */;const verificationResponseSecret = /* verification response secret, as provided in the Developer Portal */;const signature = crypto    .createHmac('sha256', verificationResponseSecret)    .update('${status}:${payload}')    .digest('hex');</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>NOTE: The redirect URL is intentionally not part of the signature algorithm. This allows easier signature validation within services that might modify the request URL, such as reverse-proxies, load-balancers, among others.</p>
