			<p>After you create your account on the
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">Epic Games Developer Portal</a>
				(Dev Portal), you are ready to get started!</p>
			<p>An overview of the onboarding phase and the requirements for distribution are provided below, along with a recommended workflow for using the Epic Games Store publishing tools. As you begin, review this information (and the provided additional resources) to understand what you can expect throughout the distribution process.</p>
			<div>
				<strong>Important Note</strong>: By default, new organizations can follow the standard onboarding process (<a href="#onboarding-process">outlined below</a>) to access the Epic Games Store publishing tools. If you created your organization prior to March 9, 2023, review these
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/publishing-workflow#before-you-begin">next steps</a>
				to learn more about gaining access to the publishing tools.

			<p>The onboarding phase is the first step towards distributing your
				<span>
					<span>product</span>
				</span>
				on the Epic Games Store.</p>
			<p>During onboarding, you will set up your organization in the Dev Portal and complete a few required tasks (listed below). Once these tasks are complete, your organization receives access to the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Epic Games Store Agreements</strong>: In order to use the publishing tools, a legal signatory for your organization must accept the Epic Games Store Distribution agreement. Depending on your organization's unique needs, additional agreements (such as the Email Sharing Rider) may be needed.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Submission Fee</strong>: A submission fee of $100 USD (or local currency equivalent), plus local taxes if applicable, is required for each product you intend to distribute. You are prompted to provide this fee during the onboarding process in the Dev Portal.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: While this fee is non-refundable, it is recoupable in the payment made after your product has earned at least $1000.00 in revenue from Epic Games Store purchases (and in-game purchases using the Epic Payment Platform). If you have any questions about the submission fee,
							<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
							on our Developer Support site for assistance.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Product Questionnaire</strong>: During the onboarding process in the Dev Portal, you are prompted to complete a preliminary questionnaire about your product. This questionnaire helps the Epic Games Store team identify how to best support your product during the distribution process. While completing the questionnaire is required, your responses are non-binding.</li>
			</ul>

				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/publishing-workflow#onboarding">Onboarding Phase</a>
			</p>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you will also complete a brief tax interview form and set up your payout account. Prepare your identity, tax, and payout details as your organization's information will undergo verification. This process can take up to 2 weeks to complete and is required in order to submit your product for final review prior to launch.</p>

				<h2 id="requirements--guidelines">Requirements &amp; Guidelines</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Before using the Epic Games Store publishing tools, we strongly recommend reviewing our requirements and guidelines for distributing products on the storefront. Reviewing these policies early in the process ensures you understand the expectations and criteria that must be met in order to launch your product.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="distribution-requirements">Distribution Requirements</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To promote a trustworthy and consistent experience for users, the Epic Games Store maintains a number of requirements for distribution. When your product is reviewed by the Epic Games Store team prior to launch, we will verify that your submission is complete and compliant with these policies.</p>
			<p>Requirements for distribution include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Products featuring multiplayer functionality must support crossplay across all PC storefronts where the product is distributed.</li>
				<li>Products that offer achievements on other PC storefronts that sell 3rd-party products must have Epic Games Store achievements enabled.</li>
				<li>Products with in-app purchases must disclose that information on their product page in the storefront.</li>
				<li>Products leveraging blockchain technology (cryptocurrency, NFT, etc.) must follow specific guidelines to provide transparency to users.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>

			</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store does not require products to be rated. However, ratings are
				<strong>required</strong>
				in the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some regions require ratings from specific authorities in order to distribute products in those areas. Such regions include South Korea, Australia, Brazil, and Russia.</li>
				<li>Products that have received ratings from any official rating authority must display that information on their product page in the storefront.</li>
				<li>Products leveraging blockchain or NFT technology in any capacity must be rated in order to be distributed on the Epic Games Store.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While you can distribute your product as an unrated title in regions without specific requirements, be aware that unrated products are treated as having the highest-level maturity rating for each region where they are distributed.</p>
			<p>To best reach potential users on the storefront, obtaining ratings for your product is
				<strong>highly recommended</strong>. If you do not have ratings for your product, you can quickly obtain an IARC rating through the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>

			<div>
				<h3 id="content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store maintains a set of content guidelines for products on the storefront. These guidelines cover a variety of topics, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Storefront content</li>
				<li>Prohibited content</li>
				<li>Linked-to and user-generated content</li>
				<li>Localization</li>

			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store publishing tools provide you with everything you need to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store. To ensure a successful launch of your product, our recommended workflow includes the following phases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Onboarding</strong>: To get started, set up your organization, complete the required onboarding tasks, and provide your tax and payout information.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Publish Your Product Page (Early Awareness)</strong>: If you have not yet released your product, we recommend publishing your product page at the same time as your product announcement to help spread early awareness. To complete this step, provide preliminary configurations for a variety of entities to create your store presence, such as product settings, ratings, and your base game offer.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Finalize and Test Configurations</strong>: Next, complete all the configurations needed to launch your product, such as uploading your build or creating additional offers. Then, conduct testing to ensure your product is ready for review by the Epic Games Store team.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Submit for Final Review</strong>: Prior to launch, submit your product for review. The Epic Games Store team will review your content and builds to ensure they meet our requirements and guidelines.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Launch Your Product</strong>: Once your product has been approved, you are ready to publish your product to the Epic Games Store!</li>
			</ul>
