			<p>The Epic First Run program is an opt-in exclusivity program for developers on the Epic Games Store. If you are eligible and participate, you can boost your net revenue from user spending on eligible products from 88<i>%</i>
				to 100<i>%</i>
				in your first six months on the Epic Games Store. After the six-month run, you will continue to benefit from Epic’s 88<i>%</i>
				/ 12<i>%</i>
				revenue split.</p>
			<p>Participating products in the Epic First Run program are presented to users on-store with the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exclusive badging</li>
				<li>Homepage placements</li>
				<li>Dedicated collections</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Epic Games features your products in relevant store campaigns, including sales, events, and editorial as applicable. A product benefits from continued exposure while it is in the Epic First Run Program.</p>
			<p>The program allows developers of any scale to activate Epic's global audience right at launch.</p>
			<p>To get the most benefit from this program, promote your products early and often with your target audience. For guidance on publishing best practices, see documentation:
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/product-marketing-tips">Product Marketing Tips</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
