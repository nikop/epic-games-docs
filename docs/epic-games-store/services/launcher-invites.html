			</div>
			<p>To promote an optimal player experience, the Epic Games Store supports session invites from Epic Online Services (EOS) integrated games via an explicit opt-in system. This allows users from outside the store ecosystem to invite Epic Games Store users to their game session.</p>
			<p>This functionality is facilitated by mapping your
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/product-management#deployments">deployments</a>
				to your Epic Games Store artifacts. In the context of the Epic Games Store, an
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip artifact" tabindex="0" role="button">artifact</span>
				</span>
				represents your product's downloadable content, such as game clients. By mapping deployments to your artifacts, EOS-initiated invites are routed through the Epic Games Store ecosystem to users in the Epic Games Launcher.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Leveraging your artifacts to expose game invites on the Epic Games Launcher requires use of the EOS SDK 1.11 or higher.</p>

				<h2 id="mapping-artifacts-to-deployments">Mapping Artifacts to Deployments</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To map your artifacts to deployments, follow the steps below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Product Settings</strong>
					and select the
					<strong>Sandboxes</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>Locate the appropriate sandbox to work in and click
					<strong>Deployments</strong>.</li>
				<li>Next to the appropriate deployment, click the
					<strong>menu (...) icon</strong>
					and choose
					<strong>Link Artifacts</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select each artifact you wish to link with the specific deployment. Then, use the
					<strong>grip icon</strong>
					to arrange the artifacts in priority order.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: When multiple artifacts are mapped to a single deployment, the Launcher routes the game invite to the first locally-installed artifact it finds following the priority order specified.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Additional Notes</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your production artifact should always be mapped to your Live deployment to ensure that invites are deliverable to your users in the Epic Games Store.</li>
				<li>Do not map DLC artifacts to a deployment. Only base game launchable artifacts should be mapped to deployments.</li>
				<li>While numerous artifacts may be displayed in Dev Portal, enabling internal test artifacts along with the production artifact should not result in issues handling invites as users will only have the production artifact installed. This allows multiple internal test artifacts to be validated using the same deployment.</li>
			</ul>
