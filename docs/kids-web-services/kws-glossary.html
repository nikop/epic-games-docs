						<td>COPPA</td>
						<td>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a US federal law enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that regulates the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of 13. It imposes certain requirements on online operators who direct their websites, apps, or online services to children under the age of 13 and requires them to obtain verifiable consent from the children's parents before collecting, using, or disclosing children's information.

						<td>Parent Verification</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>ParentGraph</td>
						<td>A pool of the hashed email addresses of parents who have successfully completed the KWS parent verification (PV) process. The ParentGraph enables KWS to determine if the parent is pre-verified the next time they encounter the PV service. ‘Pre-verified’ means the parent’s hashed email address is included in the ParentGraph, and the parent has previously verified their identity using a verification method that is (or was, at the time of verification) enabled for the digital experience currently being accessed. Pre-verified parents do not have to provide any verification credentials in the PV service. Parents can opt out of the ParentGraph if they wish. If they do so, they are no longer pre-verified.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Product</td>
