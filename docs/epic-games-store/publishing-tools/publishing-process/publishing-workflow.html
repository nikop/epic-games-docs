			<p>Epic Games Store publishing tools provide you with everything you need to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store. With these tools, you can maintain your productâ€™s store presence, create offers, manage price tiers, and more.</p>
			<p>To ensure a successful launch of your product on the storefront, follow the publishing tools workflow described in this page. This workflow consists of the following steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="#step-1-onboarding">Step 1. Onboarding</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#step-2-optional-publish-your-product-page-early-awareness">Step 2. Publish Your Product Page (Early Awareness)</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#step-3-finalize-and-test-configurations">Step 3. Finalize and Test Configurations</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="#step-4-submit-for-final-review">Step 4. Submit for Final Review</a>

					This step has details of the Epic Games Store

				<li>
					<a href="#step-5-launch-your-product">Step 5. Launch Your Product</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each step includes an estimated time to complete. Note that these are general guidelines only and are subject to change. Times can vary based on unique business needs, volume of requests, or the level of configuration required.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You are going to use the Epic Games Developer Portal to set up and manage your product (game or other software application). The Developer Portal is a browser-based tool you use to set up and configure your product on the Epic Games Store, but you can also use it for the following purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up Epic Online Services (EOS), both EOS Game Services and EOS Epic Account Services, for your product.<br>
					Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services">Epic Online Services (EOS) Overview</a>.</li>
				<li>Set up user seats for Epic Tools (Unreal Engine, Twinmotion, MetaHuman, or RealityCapture).<br>
					Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/dev-portal/dev-portal-intro">Developer Portal Introduction</a>
					- information on the Developer Portal and links to Epic Tools documentation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to set up EOS or Epic Tools to follow the Epic Games Store get started steps.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="about-onboarding">About Onboarding</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The onboarding step described below takes you through the following sub-steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create an Epic Games account and organization on the Developer Portal.</li>
				<li>Set up your organization to access Epic Games Store distribution.</li>
				<li>Add your game or software application as a product in the Developer Portal for Epic Games Store distribution.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You might have already completed some of the onboarding sub-steps before the publishing tools launched in March 2023. If you  set up an organization but have only implemented Epic Online Services (EOS - Game Services or Epic Account Services) or not yet implemented any services, you can migrate your product to using Epic Games Store.</p>

			<ol>

				<li>Click Epic Games Store.</li>

			</div>
			<p>Once you have completed onboarding, you can choose to publish your product page to the storefront for early awareness.  If you do not wish to create early awareness at this stage, you can skip this step and proceed to
				<a href="#step-3-finalize-and-test-configurations">Step 3. Finalize and Test Configurations</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you have not yet launched your product on other storefronts, we recommend that you complete this step to spread early awareness of your product.<br>
					We recommend that you publish your product page when you announce your product. This ensures users know it will be available on the Epic Games Store. It also allows users to wishlist your product and receive notifications (if they have opted-in).</li>
				<li>If you have already launched your product on other storefronts, you might choose to skip this step and proceed to
					<a href="#step-3-finalize-and-test-configurations">Step 3. Finalize and Test Configurations</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To publish your product page for early discovery, you must provide preliminary configurations for elements of your product's Epic Games Store presence. These elements, known as "entities", are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Store Settings (Product Configuration, Regions and Ratings)</li>
				<li>Base Offer and Offer Dates</li>
				<li>Home Page</li>
				<li>Optional: Localization</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You do not need to fully configure these entities in this step. In
				<a href="#step-3-finalize-and-test-configurations">Step 3. Finalize and Test Configurations</a>, you can provide additional information and upload your product binary files (executable code file and any supporting files) to prepare for launch.</p>

						<li>Types of content examples: offers, editions, season passes, chapters, or any other content you want users to download.</li>

					An artifact represents a single downloadable piece of content in your product, such as a game client or mod editor. You can attach multiple binary files to an artifact.</li>

			<p>After your product is approved by the Epic Games Store team, you are ready to launch your product on the Epic Games Store. You do this by pushing your product to the Live sandbox on the Developer Portal, we call this "publishing" your product. Publishing your product makes it available for purchase in the Epic Games Store.  When you push your product to the Live sandbox, you can choose to either publish your product immediately or at a scheduled time.</p>

				<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The visibility of your product's page or pages depend on the dates you configured for your offers. For example, if an offer has dates set in the future, that offer is not available to users until that time.</li>
				<li>If you push your product to the Live sandbox with a publish date set to a future time, your product is not visible on the storefront until that time. However, once your product is in the Live sandbox, it is indexable on the public web. Ensure you are ready for your product to be public information before pushing it to Live.</li>
				<li>You can cancel a scheduled publish before the scheduled publish date. To do this, click the
					<strong>Cancel</strong>
					button on the Release Management page.</li>
