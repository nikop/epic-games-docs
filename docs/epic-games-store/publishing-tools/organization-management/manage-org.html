			<p>An organization is the highest level entity in the
				<span>

				management ecosystem. Your organization is created during the onboarding process and can be managed at any time through the Organization section of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<div>
				In order to access the Epic Games Store publishing tools, your organization type must be set to
				<em>Enterprise</em>. This allows the owner of your organization to accept the required agreements on behalf of your organization as a legal signatory.  You can manage your organization type via the Settings tab of the Organization page.</div>
			<p>The Organization section of the Dev Portal includes options for managing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Members</strong>: Individual team members of your organization, their roles, and the products they can access. Team members with an Admin role can invite and manage other members of their organization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Notifications</strong>: Email addresses that have been set up to receive email notifications related to various Dev Portal services. Only team members with an Admin role can configure these notifications.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Roles</strong>: All default and customized roles that can be assigned to team members, granting permissions for different tools in the Dev Portal. Team members with an Admin role can create customized roles.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Trader, Tax, and Payout Info</strong>: Trader, tax, and payout information for your organization. You typically provide this information during the onboarding process.
					<ul>

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="organization-management">Organization Management</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The sections below outline some common actions that can be taken in the Organization section of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="invite-team-members">Invite Team Members</h3>
			</div>
			<p>If all necessary team members were not added to your organization during the onboarding process, you can add additional members before beginning Store Configuration.</p>
			<p>To invite a team member to your organization, follow the steps below.</p>
			<div>
				<p>All team members must have an Epic Games account before you can invite them to the organization. To complete the invitation, you must use the email addresses associated with their Epic Games accounts.</p>
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, select
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					from the main navigation menu. Then, choose the
					<strong>Members</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>To the top right of the Member table, click
					<strong>Invite</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the popup, enter the appropriate information for the team member:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Email address</strong>: The email address associated with the member's Epic Games account.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Role</strong>: The primary role of the new member.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Products</strong>: The products associated with your organization that the member can access in the Dev Portal. You can select one or more individual products from the list, or choose the All Products option. Some role types, such as Admin, automatically have access to all products.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Review the Invite form to ensure accuracy. Then, click
					<strong>Invite</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>An email is then sent to the provided email address with next steps for the member to join your organization. Once they join, their information displays in the Members table on the Members tab.</p>
			<p>Active invites display in the Invite table located on the Members tab. (Note that this table only displays if there is at least one active invite for your organization). If a member does not accept an invite or missed the email, you can resend the invitation through the Invite table. To do so, select the menu (...) icon to the right of the appropriate row in the table and choose Resend.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="create-custom-roles">Create Custom Roles</h3>
			</div>
			<p>On the Roles tab, you can review the roles associated with your organization. Roles are assigned to team members to determine their level of access within the Dev Portal. Each role consists of a set of permissions that grant access to specific features or areas of the Dev Portal, including features within the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>
			<p>Upon creating your organization, a number of roles are available to you by default. These default roles provide predefined levels of access to different areas of the Dev Portal. For example, assigning the default
				<em>Store Self-Publishing</em>
				role to a team member grants them access to all features of the publishing tools. The permission set associated with a default role cannot be modified; permissions cannot be added or removed from these roles.</p>
			<p>As needed, admin users can also create custom roles. Custom roles allow organizations to tailor different levels of access for their team members. When creating a custom role, you can select the specific permissions the role grants a user when it is assigned to them.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Publishing Tool Permissions</strong>

			<p>In order to access the Epic Games Store publishing tools, the following permissions are required:</p>
			<ul>

				<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
			</div>
			<p>After your organization has been created in the Dev Portal, additional steps are required in order to access the Epic Games Store publishing tools. These steps include the completion of the following items:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Submission Fee</strong>: A submission fee of $100 USD (or local currency equivalent), plus local taxes if applicable, is required for each product you intend to distribute. While this fee is non-refundable, it is recoupable in the payment made after your product has earned at least $1000.00 in revenue from Epic Games Store purchases (and in-game purchases using the Epic Payment Platform). If you have any questions about the submission fee,
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site for assistance.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Product Questionnaire</strong>: You must complete a preliminary questionnaire about the product you wish to distribute on the Epic Games Store. Your responses to these questions are non-binding and are intended to help us identify the best support for your product.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To complete these tasks, follow the steps below. Completing this process is only required once per product.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store</strong>.</li>
				<li>Upon your first visit to this section of the Dev Portal, a multi-step onboarding popup displays. Through this popup, you can review important Epic Games Store distribution details, pay the submission fee, and complete the questionnaire.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: You can exit this popup at any time and return later to complete the process. To do so, simply return to
							<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store</strong>
							to relaunch the popup.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once each step has been completed, you are granted access to the Epic Games Store section of the Dev Portal. This section facilitates the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition to completing the onboarding process above, ensure that you also complete any appropriate agreements for your organization and provide your trader, tax, and payout information. You must complete these tasks to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store.</p>
