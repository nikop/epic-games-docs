			<p>Clients are any software application that accesses any Epic Online Services (EOS) service for your product (product: game or other software application). Client policies ensure only the clients you want to access your product's EOS service can access it.</p>
			<p>EOS uses Okta's AuthO Client Credentials Flow (see Okta's documentation website on client credentials at
				<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/flows/client-credentials-flow">auth0.com</a>
				for details).</p>
			<p>When created, each EOS client is automatically assigned a Client ID and a Client Secret (a password) that you must use for authentication. This information is passed in the
				<a href="/docs/api-ref/structs/eos-platform-client-credentials">EOS_Platform_ClientCredentials</a>
				structure as a parameter of
				<a href="/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-platform-create">EOS_Platform_Create</a>
				so the SDK can recognize the program as a valid EOS client, authorize it, and grant it access to the features determined by its client policy.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Legacy Clients</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The EOS service automatically associates clients created before the introduction of client policies with a client policy matching the client's originally-assigned role. It is marked with the label "Legacy".</li>
				<li>We recommend you review your use of client policies. If your product is not running dedicated servers, but allows clients to host peer-to-peer matches, consider updating your policy to the new Peer2Peer policy or an appropriate custom policy.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="manage-clients-and-client-policies-for-your-product">Manage Clients and Client Policies for Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To view and and manage your clients and client policies, go to the Product Settings page and click
				<strong>Clients</strong>.</p>
			<p>To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your product page:
					<ul>
						<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), from the left navigation, under
							<strong>Your Products</strong>,  click the name of your product. (<strong>Note</strong>: You might have to click
							<strong>Back to organization</strong>
							before you can do this.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once you are in your product page, from the left navigation, click
					<strong>Product Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>The default tab is SDK Download &amp; Credentials. Click
					<strong>Clients</strong>.</li>
				<li>The Clients tab might show new agreements to accept. Scroll down to see the
					<strong>Clients</strong>
					section of the tab and the
					<strong>Client Policies</strong>
					section of the tab.<br>
					Notes:
					<ul>
						<li>You might have to accept the new agreements before you can add a client policy.</li>
						<li>You must add client policy before you can add a new client.</li>
						<li>You can associate one client policy with multiple clients.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Follow the onscreen instructions to add new client policies and new clients.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The following are examples of clients:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Game clients used by players on their local devices to play your game.</li>
						<li>Software clients used by software users on their local devices to run your software application.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Trusted servers as clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Your product might use non-EOS services that are complementary to EOS services. These non-EOS services are known as “trusted servers”. Trusted servers require access to your product's user data, so you must add them as a "client".</li>
						<li>Any other use for a client you choose.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You must associate a client with a client policy. You can associate one client policy with multiple clients. You cannot save a client if you do not associate it with a client policy.</p>
			<p>Clients are in one of two catagories. They are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Untrusted client<br>
						These are usually publicly-released software applications, such as your product's game client.<br>
						Do not treat the following as trusted clients:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Any servers for the community to run.</li>
						<li>Peer-to-peer clients acting as product servers. Do not assume all users run untampered versions of your released code when connecting to services with this policy.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Trusted clients<br>
						These are under your control and are not released publicly. These could be dedicated servers in your datacenter, for example. A trusted client can have more access permissions because it is running only in your environment so you can assume it is not running modified code, and so it is not a security risk.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="client-policies">Client Policies</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Client policies are crucial in securing product against unauthorized activity. Before adding a new client, you must have a client policy with the necessary permissions for that client. You can associate multiple clients with a single client policy.</p>
			<p>Examples of policy use:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If a client is using a dedicated server, you can select the
					<strong>TrustedServer</strong>
					type. This determines a set of permissions suitable for this situation.</li>
				<li>You can select
					<strong>CREATE CUSTOM POLICY</strong>
					to configure specific permissions.
					<ul>
						<li>If you create a custom policy, the
							<strong>User required</strong>
							option enables you to require a user to sign in to execute actions. For example, you can specify that a user must be signed-in to use  the functionality of lobbies or player data storage.<br>
							For further information, see the following documentation:
							<a href="/docs/game-services/lobbies">Lobbies</a>,
							<a href="/docs/game-services/player-data-storage">Player Data Storage</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="policy-types">Policy Types</h3>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Peer2Peer</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Policy for untrusted client software that want to host multiplayer matches.</li>
				<li>Requires an authenticated user.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>TrustedServer</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Policy for dedicated servers or trusted software applications.</li>
				<li>Includes the ability to create matchmaking sessions and ingest stats on behalf of users.</li>
				<li>Does not require an authenticated user.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>GameClient</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Policy for untrusted client software.</li>
				<li>Requires an authenticated user.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>GameClient /w UnlockAchievements</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Like GameClient, but allows the client to unlock player achievements.</li>
				<li>Requires an authenticated user.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>CREATE CUSTOM POLICY</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creates a new policy that allows a customized set of actions for each service.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="client-policy-permission-evaluation">Client Policy Permission Evaluation</h3>
			</div>
			<p>All requests are denied by default. Only actions that are added in the Client Policy are allowed.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h4>
			</div>
			<p>When trouble shooting any errors, check the logs for more details about your issue.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>For EOS SDK versions 1.10 and earlier, any errors with this service return as
						<code>EOS_Unexpected_Error</code>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>For EOS SDK versions 1.10 and later, the following table lists potentials errors:</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Error</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Resolution</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_NotConfigured</code>
						</td>
						<td>The client permission is not set up for this call.</td>
						<td>Go to the Developer Portal and configure a policy for this client.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_AcessDenied</code>
						</td>
						<td>The client permission is set up for this call, but the call fails a check (e.g. you used a correctly set-up client, but tried to access another user's private player data storage).</td>
						<td>Check the logs for more details about your issue and contact support.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_InvalidAuth</code>
						</td>
						<td>The client is configured to require a signed-in user, but the client's credentials are not allowed.</td>
						<td>Check the logs for more details about your issue and contact support.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_AccessDenied</code>
						</td>
						<td>The client policy forbids this client from calling. It is likely that the Developer Portal is configured to not allow your client access to the call.</td>
						<td>Go to the Developer Portal and modify the client configuration. Or make a new policy that allows the given permission.</td>
					</tr>
