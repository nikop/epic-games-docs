			<p>Pre-purchase sales (known as “pre-purchase”) means that users can pay for your product,  even though you have not yet released it. Use the following best practices and guidelines to help ensure a successful pre-purchase launch of your product on the Epic Games Store.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="enable-pre-purchase-for-your-product">Enable Pre-Purchase for Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The pre-purchase functionality is only available for select products at this time.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="set-up-a-pre-purchase">Set up a Pre-Purchase</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can set up pre-purchase for base games, editions, add-ons with artifacts, and digital extras. Note that you must provide a
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/glossary#b">binary</a>
				to set up pre-purchase.</p>
			<p>You can set up pre-purchase between 24 hours and 30 days before the pre-purchase release date. This limitation is due to the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Planned launch dates are less likely to change 30 days or less in advance.</li>
				<li>There are payment provider restrictions for refunds.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There might be exceptions in cases where an appropriately scaled marketing plan can support a longer duration of pre-purchase. To contact the Epic Games Store team for assistance with this, create a private discussion using this support website:
				<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/private-question-page">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</p>
			<p>You cannot remove a pre-purchase date after you push an offer to the Stage sandbox.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="incentives">Incentives</h2>
			</div>
			<p>We have seen greater success when incentives are included with pre-purchases. Potential incentives could be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Early access (prior to launch date).</li>
				<li>Closed Beta access or Early access to an Open Beta.</li>
				<li>Additional content such as add-ons or in-game bonuses.</li>
				<li>Digital extras such as soundtracks, art books, or others.</li>
				<li>A substantial price discount.
					<ul>

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Any combination of the above.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="ratings">Ratings</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Pre-purchase offers do not require ratings. However, if the game has been rated by a ratings board, then you must display the rating (you must include a “Rating Pending” or similar icon if appropriate).</p>
			<p>If your product is not expected to meet the rating requirements for a certain region by the launch day, then you must block the pre-purchase offer for that specific region.</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Users can cancel their pre-purchase of a product and get a refund at any time before the launch date. After the product is released, users can request a refund within 14 days if they have less than two hours of runtime on record.</p>
			<p>In cases where there is a bundle of pre-purchase products, such as a base game and a pre-purchase DLC, the same rules apply. If a user plays the base game for more than 2 hours, they will not be able to receive a refund.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="delayed-launch-date">Delayed Launch Date</h3>
			</div>
			<p>We understand that plans change and delays happen. Please let us know as soon as possible if your product’s launch date slips when pre-purchase is enabled on the product. To contact the Epic Games Store team for assistance with this, create a private discussion using this support website:
				<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/private-question-page">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</p>
			<p>We will inform users who bought the pre-purchase offer of the change and notify them as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the delay is
					<strong>less</strong>
					than 30 days from the original release date, we’ll notify the users of the new release date and give them the opportunity to cancel their pre-purchase.</li>
				<li>If the delay is
					<strong>more</strong>
					than 30 days from the original release date, we'll notify users of the new release date and automatically refund their pre-purchase. They can pre-purchase again if they choose to do so.</li>
				<li>If the delay is indefinite and the release date is unknown, we'll notify users and automatically refund their pre-purchase. They can pre-purchase again if they choose to do so. Your Product home page will return to a “Coming Soon” state because the release date is unknown.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We suggest that you also communicate any date changes directly to your user base as soon as possible.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="blocked-pre-purchase-launches">Blocked Pre-Purchase Launches</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Be sure to meet our
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines">Requirements &amp; Guidelines</a>
				before your launch date.  If you are unable to comply with them, then your release date will be blocked and we will inform purchasers of the delay and notify them as outlined above.</p>
