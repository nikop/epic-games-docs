			</div>
			<p>Marketing is a critical step on the path to any successful product release. It’s how you build awareness among potential customers and ensure that your product stands out in a crowd. Every product is unique and deserves its own marketing plan, but here are a few general best practices that can help you get started.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="launch-your-coming-soon-page-for-early-awareness">Launch your “Coming Soon” Page for Early Awareness</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Start spreading awareness of your product early by launching your Coming Soon page at the same time you announce your product. Don’t wait until your product is available for purchase. Roll out your presence on the storefront at the same time as your announcement so that users know your product will be available on the Epic Games Store.</p>

				<h2 id="encourage-users-to-wishlist-your-product">Encourage Users to Wishlist your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>On your official website or social media accounts, provide links to your product’s presence on the Epic Games Store and encourage users to wishlist your product. Wishlisting offers the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users who have opted in to communications receive:
					<ul>
						<li>Email updates about your product</li>
						<li>Push notifications about your product via the Epic Games Store PC client</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Your product gains boosted visibility to users in the From Your Wishlist area of the storefront</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<p>Ensure users know where your product is available for purchase by including Epic Games Store branding in your marketing assets. If you create custom marketing assets for your product, such as trailers or gameplay screenshots, add Epic Games Store logos or other branding elements alongside other platform logos to help inform users.</p>

			<p>Once your product is available, use an effective discounting strategy to help you maximize sales and continually reach new customers. You can use Epic Games Store campaigns to gain visibility during major tentpole promotions (i.e., holiday sales) and custom sales to amplify your own marketing beats.</p>
