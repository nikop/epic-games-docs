				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In the Developer Portal (Dev Portal), you can create and manage discounts for your
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers">offers</a>.</p>
			<p>When you apply a discount to an offer, the storefront displays strikethrough pricing. This means that the storefront displays the discounted price alongside the regular price to highlight the comparison to users.</p>
			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, discounts are defined by two primary elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the discount is available on the storefront, as determined by its start and end dates/times.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Discount value</strong>: The percentage decrease applied to the offer's base price, such as 25<i>%</i>
					off.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create two types of discount for your offers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Custom discount</strong>: A discount with a customized campaign name and start and end dates provided by your organization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Preset campaign</strong>: A discount that is associated with an Epic Games Store sale or an event that includes preset start and end dates (for example, the Epic Games MEGA Sale).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For both types of discount, you can specify the percentage decrease. However, some Epic-led preset campaigns require the discount value to be in a specific range.</p>
			<p>There are guidelines for discounts on the Epic Games Store. When you create a discount, it automatically undergoes validation. This ensures that your discount follows the guidelines before it appears on the storefront.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-guidelines">Discount Guidelines</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store maintains a number of guidelines for discounts on the storefront. During creation, discounts undergo validation to verify that these policies have been followed.</p>
			<p>The following discount guidelines apply on a per-product basis for both custom discounts and Epic Games preset campaigns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can apply only one discount to a product offer in a specific timeframe. In other words, multiple discounts cannot be active for a single offer at the same time.</li>
				<li>You must submit the discount at least 24 hours before the discount start date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be a value between 5<i>%</i>
					and 95<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>For post-launch discounts, the duration cannot exceed 30 consecutive days. For introductory offers, the following guidelines apply:
					<ul>
						<li>The duration cannot exceed seven consecutive days.</li>
						<li>The discount amount must be a maximum of 40<i>%</i>.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Note:</strong>
							An introductory offer is a discount applied to your product offer at the time of its release. To learn more, see
							<a href="#create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</a>
							on this page.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You cannot discount a product offer cannot for more than 45 days total during any 90-day window.</li>
				<li>You must allow a minimum 30-day cooldown period between discounts that you apply to a specific product offer.</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule discounts within the following time windows:
					<ul>
						<li>Within 30 days of a product’s launch date.</li>
						<li>Within 30 days of the end of an introductory offer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Products in a pre-purchase state can have discounts, but the discounts start together with pre-purchase and end when the product launches. You can convert the discount to an introductory offer after the product launches. However, the following guidelines apply:
					<ul>
						<li>The discount must be the same discount value as the introductory offer.</li>
						<li>You must configure the discount at the same time as you configure the pre-purchase discount.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule a discount for a date within 30 days of a price change. In other words, you must schedule discounts for a date at least 31 days after a price change.</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 id="create-custom-or-preset-campaign-discount">Create Custom or Preset Campaign Discount</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create both custom and preset campaign discounts for your product offers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom discounts allow you to create your own discount campaigns with customized start and end dates. These dates determine when a discount is active on the storefront.</li>
				<li>Preset campaigns are associated with an Epic Games Store sale or event (for example, the Epic Games MEGA Sale) and include preset start and end dates. These dates cannot be modified.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To be eligible for a discount, a product offer must follow these guidelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It must be in the Live sandbox.</li>
				<li>It must not be a demo offer.</li>
				<li>It must not have a base price of $0.</li>
				<li>It must have a specific launch date assigned. Discounts cannot be created for offers with an estimated or unknown launch date.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>Discounts applied to offers at the time of their release must meet specific criteria. To learn more, see
				<a href="#create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</a>

							</ul>
						</li>

				<li>
					<p>Click
						<strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your discount automatically undergoes validation to ensure that it adheres to our
							<a href="#discount-guidelines">guidelines</a>. Then, if the discount review process is applicable for your organization, it is automatically sent to the Epic Games Store team for approval. See
							<a href="#submit-discounts-for-validation-and-review">Submit Discounts for Validation and Review</a>
							on this page for more information.</li>
						<li>If the discount does not adhere to our
							<a href="#discount-guidelines">discount guidelines</a>, a validation error displays at the top of the screen. The Offers section shows error details for each affected offer. Update your discount as needed to resolve the issues, then click
							<strong>Submit</strong>
							again.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

					<em>Published</em>.</li>
				<li>If the discount review process is applicable for your organization, its status is
					<em>Queued for review</em>.</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<p>An introductory offer is a discount applied to a product offer at the time of the product's release, such as a launch day sale. The product offer must revert to full price no later than seven days after release.</p>
			<p>The discount created for an introductory offer must meet the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The start date and time of the discount must exactly match the product offer’s launch date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be between 5<i>%</i>
					and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>The duration cannot be more than seven days.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The product offer receiving the discount must have a specific release date assigned that matches its effective date (for example, the date the product offer becomes purchasable on the storefront). Make a note of this date and time as you need this information to create your introductory offer.</p>
			<p>To create an introductory offer, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Create a new offer or update an existing offer.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Set the offer's Launch Date to the date and time of your product launch. Take note of this date and time because you need this information to create your discount.</p>

					<p>In the Dev Portal, go to
						<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Release Management</strong>.</p>
				</li>

						<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Promo Campaigns &gt; Discount Management Tool</strong>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Create a new custom discount as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Set the Start Date and Time to the launch date and time of your offer.</li>
						<li>Set the End Date and Time to no later than seven days after the start date and time.</li>
						<li>Set the Discount Rate to a value between 5<i>%</i>

				</li>
				<li>

						<strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If any validation errors occur, you must resolve those issues before you can submit the discount again. To learn more, see
