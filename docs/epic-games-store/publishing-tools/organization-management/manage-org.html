				<button tabindex="0" type="button" aria-label="Copy link to this section"></button>
			</div>
			<p>If all necessary team members were not added to your organization during the onboarding process, you can add additional members before beginning Store Configuration.</p>
			<p>To invite a team member to your organization, follow the steps below.</p>
			<div>
				<p>All team members must have an Epic Games account before you can invite them to the organization. To complete the invitation, you must use the email addresses associated with their Epic Games accounts.</p>
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, select
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					from the main navigation menu. Then, choose the
					<strong>Members</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>To the top right of the Member table, click
					<strong>Invite</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the popup, enter the appropriate information for the team member:
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Email address</strong>: The email address associated with the memberâ€™s Epic Games account.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Role</strong>: The primary role of the new member.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Products</strong>: The products associated with your organization that the member can access in the Dev Portal. You can select one or more individual products from the list, or choose the All Products option. Some role types, such as Admin, automatically have access to all products.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Review the Invite form to ensure accuracy. Then, click
					<strong>Invite</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>An email is then sent to the provided email address with next steps for the member to join your organization. Once they join, their information displays in the Members table on the Members tab.</p>
			<p>Active invites display in the Invite table located on the Members tab. (Note that this table only displays if there is at least one active invite for your organization). If a member does not accept an invite or missed the email, you can resend the invitation through the Invite table. To do so, select the menu (...) icon to the right of the appropriate row in the table and choose Resend.</p>
