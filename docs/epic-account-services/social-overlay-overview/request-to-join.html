			<p>If a player is in a private game instance (only joinable via invite, as opposed to presence), their Epic friends can't automatically join them. In this case, the player's Epic friends can instead send them a request to join their private game through the Social Overlay. For more information on the Social Overlay, see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview">Social Overlay Overview</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Request to Join isn't available for the Epic Games Launcher. It is only available through the Social Overlay. If you prefer not to use the Social Overlay and instead want to use your own custom UI to handle requests to join, you can use the methods listed in the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/request-to-join#requests-methods">Request Methods</a>
				section below to handle requests.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="set-up-request-to-join">Set Up Request to Join</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To allow players to request to join game instances, you must set up your game in the Developer Portal:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sign in to the Developer Portal at
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>.</li>
				<li>On the home page, from the left-hand side of the page, select your game's product name under
					<strong>PRODUCTS</strong>.</li>
				<li>Set the
					<code>RequestToJoin</code>
					flag. Go to
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Product Settings</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Clients</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Client policies</strong>
					and either select an existing policy by selecting ... and
					<strong>Edit</strong>
					from the dropdown menu, or select
					<strong>ADD NEW CLIENT POLICY</strong>.</li>
				<li>Go to
					<strong>Features</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Notifications</strong>
					and select the
					<strong>sendRequestToJoinToAnyUser</strong>
					checkbox.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: To allow players to request to join your lobby or session, it must have presence enabled. To enable presence for a lobby or session, set
				<code>EOS_Bool bPresenceEnabled = EOS_TRUE</code>
				in
				<code>EOS_Sessions_CreateSessionModificationOptions</code>
				(the struct of input parameters for
				<code>EOS_Sessions_CreateSessionModification</code>).</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="request-to-join-flow">Request to Join Flow</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When a player request to join their friend, this is the typical flow in the Social Overlay:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Player A is in a private lobby that is presence enabled.</li>
				<li>Player B (a friend of Player A) sees that Player A is in a lobby and wants to join but cannot join via presence since the lobby is private.</li>
				<li>Player B clicks the
					<strong>REQUEST TO JOIN</strong>
					button on Player A's profile in the Social Overlay, which sends the request to join to Player A.</li>
				<li>Player A clicks one of the following buttons:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>ACCEPT JOIN REQUEST</strong>: Sends an invite to Player B.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>IGNORE JOIN REQUEST</strong>: Clears the request to join notification for Player A and sends a notification to Player B. Player B does not receive an indication via the Social Overlay of the rejection; this is intentional, to remove any potential negativity in this space.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After the requesting player receives and accepts an invitation, you can use the existing invitation workflows for lobbies and sessions to invite the requesting player to the private game. See the documentation for more information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lobby:
					<a href="/docs/game-services/lobbies#inviting-users-to-a-lobby">Inviting Users to a Lobby</a>
				</li>
				<li>Session:
					<a href="/docs/game-services/sessions#inviting-players-to-a-session">Inviting Players to a Session</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="requests-methods">Requests Methods</h2>
			</div>
			<p>If you create your own custom UI to use instead of the Social Overlay, you can use the public methods shown in the table below to handle requests to join.</p>
			<p>The table below uses these terms to refer to players for the request to join:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Local Player: The player who requests to join the player in the private game.</li>
				<li>Remote Player: The player in the private game lobby who receives the request.</li>
			</ul>
