			<p>Through the Access Keys page, you can generate keys used for redeeming product offers in the Epic Games Store. Keys can be generated for testing, promotional, and retail use cases. Each individual access key is only redeemable for a single offer. On the Access Keys dashboard, you can monitor the number of keys you have requested and their associated offers.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="access-key-types">Access Key Types</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store offers the following types of access keys:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Testing</strong>: Testing keys are only redeemable by users who are members of your developer organization and are used for testing your product. Testing keys can only be created for offers currently in either the Dev or Stage 
					<!-- -->sandbox
					<!-- -->. You can generate a total of 5,000 testing keys. If more than 5,000 test keys are needed, the request must be approved by the Epic Games Store team.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Press/Promo</strong>: Press/Promo keys are used for marketing initiatives and communication campaigns, such as press or influencer keys, preview keys, discount codes, or rating board reviews. Promotional keys can only be generated for product offers within the Live sandbox. You can generate a total of 1,000 press/promo keys. If more than 1,000 promotional keys are needed, the request must be approved by the Epic Games Store team.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Retail</strong>: Used for partnerships and sales purposes, the Epic Games Store offers both Digital Retail and Physical Retail keys. Digital Retail keys are used for digital storefronts and distribution; Physical Retail keys are used for physical distribution, such as boxed products. Both Digital and Physical Retail keys can only be generated for products within the Live sandbox. Retail key generation must be approved by the Epic Games Store team.

					<ul>
