			<p>In the Developer Portal (Dev Portal), you can create and manage discounts for your offers.  (See the following documentation for guidance on managing offers:
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers">Manage Offers</a>.)</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-overview">Discount Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When you apply a discount to an offer, the storefront displays strikethrough pricing. This means that the storefront displays the discounted price alongside the regular price to highlight the comparison to users.</p>
			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, discounts are defined by two primary elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the discount is available on the storefront, as determined by its start and end dates/times.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Discount value</strong>: The percentage decrease applied to the offer's base price, such as 25<i>%</i>
					off.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create two types of discount for your offers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Custom discount</strong>: A discount with a customized campaign name and start and end dates provided by your organization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Preset campaign</strong>: A discount that is associated with an Epic Games Store sale or an event that includes preset start and end dates (for example, the Epic Games MEGA Sale).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For both types of discount, you can specify the percentage decrease. However, some Epic-led preset campaigns require the discount value to be in a specific range.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-guidelines">Discount Guidelines</h2>
			</div>
			<p>There are guidelines for discounts on the Epic Games Store. When you create a discount, it automatically undergoes validation. This ensures that your discount follows the guidelines before it appears on the storefront.</p>
			<p>The following discount guidelines apply on a per-product basis for both custom discounts and Epic Games preset campaigns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can apply only one discount to a product offer in a specific timeframe. In other words, multiple discounts cannot be active for a single offer at the same time.</li>
				<li>You must submit the discount at least 24 hours before the discount start date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be a value between 5<i>%</i>
					and 95<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>Post-launch discounts cannot exceed 30 consecutive days.</li>
				<li>You cannot discount a product offer for more than 45 days total during any 90-day window.</li>
				<li>You must allow a minimum 30-day cooldown period between discounts that you apply to a specific product offer.</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule discounts within the following time windows:
					<ul>
						<li>Within 30 days of a product’s launch date.</li>
						<li>Within 30 days of the end of an introductory offer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Products in a pre-purchase state can have discounts, but the discounts start together with pre-purchase and end when the product launches. You can schedule a continuation of your pre-purchase discount to covert it to an introductory offer. However, the following guidelines apply:
					<ul>
						<li>The discount must be the same discount value as the introductory offer.</li>
						<li>You must configure the discount at the same time as you configure the pre-purchase discount. Notify the Epic Games Store team before the pre-purchase discount goes live. To do so, create a private discussion using this support website:
							<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/private-question-page">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule a discount for a date within 30 days of a price change. This means that you must schedule discounts for a date at least 31 days after a price change.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following guidelines apply to any changes you make to region availability for product offers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You cannot remove a product offer from availability in a region (block a region) while it has an active discount.</li>
				<li>You can only remove a product offer from availability in a region (block a region) or add a product offer in a region (unblock a region) while the product offer does not have an active discount.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Exception</strong>: You can unblock a product offer during an active discount if you treat the active discount as an Introductory Offer. (See the section below on
							<a href="#pre-purchase-introductory-and-special-offers">Pre-Purchase, Introductory, and Special Offers</a>.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You must wait 30 days before you can start a discount on your product offer if you change the region availability of your product offer.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: You must amend any existing scheduled discount to start 30 days after you change the region availability of a product offer.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Exception</strong>: An Introductory Offer does not have to wait 30 days to start. (See the section below on
							<a href="#pre-purchase-introductory-and-special-offers">Pre-Purchase, Introductory, and Special Offers</a>.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<div>
				<h4 id="create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</h4>
			</div>
			<p>An introductory offer is a discount applied to a product offer at the time of the product's release, such as a launch day sale. The product offer must revert to full price no later than seven days after release.</p>
			<p>The discount created for an introductory offer must meet the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The start date and time of the discount must exactly match the product offer’s launch date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be between 5<i>%</i>
					and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>The duration cannot be more than seven days.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The product offer receiving the discount must have a specific release date assigned that matches its effective date (for example, the date the product offer becomes purchasable on the storefront). Make a note of this date and time as you need this information to create your introductory offer.</p>
			<p>To create an introductory offer, you need to access three different pages in the Developer Portal:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Offers page</li>
				<li>The Release Management page</li>
				<li>The Discount Management Tool page (part of the Promo Campaigns page)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To create an introductory offer, follow these steps:</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Step 1: The Offers Page</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Offers page. To do this, see the
					<a href="#page-navigation">Page Navigation</a>
					section on this page.</li>
				<li>Select the appropriate
					<span>
						<span aria-label="tooltip sandbox" tabindex="0" role="button">sandbox</span>
					</span>.</li>
				<li>Create a new offer or update an existing offer.</li>
				<li>Set the offer's Launch Date to the date and time of your product launch. Take note of this date and time because you need this information to create your discount.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Step 2: The Release Management Page</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the Release Management page.<br>
					To do this, from the left navigation in the Developer Portal, select
					<strong>Release Management</strong>.</li>
				<li>Promote your offer to the Live sandbox. You must complete this step before you create your discount.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: The offer will not be visible to users on the storefront until its Early Store Discovery or Launch Date occurs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Step 3: The Discount Management Tool Page</strong>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Go to the Discount Management Tool page. To do this, see the
						<a href="#page-navigation">Page Navigation</a>
						section on this page.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Create a new custom discount as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Set the Start Date and Time to the launch date and time of your offer.</li>
						<li>Set the End Date and Time to no later than seven days after the start date and time.</li>
						<li>Set the Discount Rate to a value between 5<i>%</i>
							and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
						<li>In the Offers section, select the offer from the steps above under,
							<strong>Step 1: The Offers Page</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Carefully review the details of your discount.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Click
						<strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If any validation errors occur, you must resolve those issues before you can submit the discount again. To learn more, see
							<a href="#discount-guidelines">discount guidelines</a>
							on this page.</li>
						<li>If the discount review process applies for your organization, then the introductory offer goes through the standard validation process. The offer is then automatically sent to the Epic Games Store team for review. To learn more, see
							<a href="#submit-discounts-for-validation-and-review">Submit Discounts for Validation and Review</a>
							below.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="submit-discounts-for-validation-and-review">Submit Discounts for Validation and Review</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When you submit your discount, it automatically goes through two processes, in the following order:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It goes through validation to ensure that it adheres to the Epic Games Store
					<a href="#discount-guidelines">guidelines</a>.</li>
				<li>If the discount review process applies to your organization, it goes to the Epic Games Store team for review. The review process typically takes 24 hours (excluding weekends).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Discounts must pass validation and review before they can become active on the storefront.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>Queued for review</code>: Your discount passed validation and is with the Epic Games Store team for review.
					<ul>
						<li>This only happens if the discount review process applies to the organization.</li>
						<li>If the discount review process is not applicable for your organization, then status is updated to Published when your discount passes validation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>Validation failed</code>
					The discount did not pass validation. You must take additional action before the discount is sent for review. For more information, see
					<em>Validation Failed</em>
					below.</li>
			</ul>

				<a href="#discount-statuses">Discount Statuses</a>
				section on this page.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="validation-failed">Validation Failed</h4>

				<code>Validation failed</code>
				status, follow the steps below to review the validation feedback:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Discount Management Tool page.  To do this, see the
					<a href="#page-navigation">Page Navigation</a>

					<code>Validation failed</code>
					status.</li>
				<li>In the discount’s options (<strong>...</strong>) menu, select
					<strong>View</strong>.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Click
							<strong>Edit Discount</strong>
							and update your discount in accordance with the feedback. Then, resubmit the discount for validation again. and review.</li>
						<li>If you cannot update your discount to adhere to our guidelines, select
							<strong>Submit with Issues Found</strong>
							to escalate your discount to the Epic Games Store team.<br>
							This option is available only if the discount review process applies to your organization. You should only use this option after you have made reasonable efforts to resolve any issues.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you submit the discount, its status updates as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the discount review process applies to  your organization, it updates to Queued for review, and the discount is routed for review.</li>
				<li>If the discount review process does not apply to your organization, it updates to Published, and the discount is published to use on the storefront.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="after-review">After Review</h4>

					The discount is published and ready to become active on the storefront during its specified time frame.</li>
				<li>
					<code>Changes Needed</code>
