			<p>Before you can distribute your products on the Epic Games Store, you must go through trader verification, create a tax profile, and activate your payout account. This process can take two weeks or more to complete beause the information provided must undergo verification. You cannot submit your product for review by the Epic Games Store team, which is a necessary part of the publishing workflow, until you complete this process.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Ensure the financial information you provide throughout this process reflects the entity type you select. For example, if you select "company" or "business" as your entity type, provide the requested information (such as IDs) for your organization rather than personal information.</p>
