			<p>An 
				<!-- -->organization
				<!-- --> is the highest level in the
				<strong>Epic Online Services (EOS)</strong>
				
				<!-- -->product
				<!-- --> management ecosystem. It encompasses all the products and the associated members, such as a publisher or game studio.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<em>Organization</em>
					- Epic Games
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em>Product</em>
							- Jazz Jackrabbit
							<!-- -->
							<ul>
								<li>
									<em>Sandbox</em>
									- Development
									<!-- -->
									<ul>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- DevGame01</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Sandbox</em>
									- Staging
									<!-- -->
									<ul>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- QATestGame01</li>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- AlphaGame</li>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- BetaGame</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>Sandbox</em>
									- Live
									<!-- -->
									<ul>
										<li>
											<em>Deployment</em>
											- LiveGame</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you create an 
				<!-- -->account
				<!-- --> on the Developer Portal and are not a member of an existing organization, a new organization is created. For existing organizations, organization
				<strong>Admins</strong>
				can add or remove members and manage their roles through the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>Once created, Admins can also configure your organization’s entity type from the
				<strong>Settings</strong>
				tab in the Developer Portal under
				<strong>Organization</strong>. Your entity type can either be a company or an individual:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Enterprise</strong>
					- Available for incorporated entities and indicates that your organization represents a legal entity.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Individual</strong>
					- The default entity type for an organization and indicates that all of the members of the organization are acting on their personal behalf.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While both entity types allow an organization to access Epic Online Services, only Enterprise organizations can leverage the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store publishing tools</a>. Additionally, members of an Enterprise organization cannot use services within the Dev Portal until the necessary agreements have been completed for your organization.</p>
			<p>The
				<strong>Organization</strong>
				page of the Developer Portal is where you
				<a href="/docs/en-US#member-management">manage</a>
				your  members, their
				<a href="/docs/en-US#roles">roles</a>, view
				<a href="/docs/en-US#licenses">licenses</a>, and configure your
				<a href="/docs/en-US#console-developer-access">console developer access</a>.</p>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>
				<div>
					<p>If you are a member of more than one organization, a prompt will ask which organization you want to access at sign-in. After sign-in, you can always select a different organization from the dropdown by your current organization’s name in the top banner.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="member-management">Member Management</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Members within your organization appear as a list on the
				<strong>Member</strong>
				tab of your
				<strong>Organization</strong>
				page in the Developer Portal. Each member is granted a
				<a href="/docs/en-US#roles">role</a>
				within the organization that gives them permissions to different tools in the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>To add a new member to your organization, click
				<strong>Invite</strong>
				on the
				<strong>Member</strong>
				tab. A prompt requests the email address of the new member, their role, and for which products. After clicking
				<strong>Invite</strong>, the new member is added to your organization once they accept the invitation.</p>
			<p>Once a member is part of your organization, an Admin can remove or change the access rights of a member by clicking on
				<strong>More Options</strong>
				for that member.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Each member has a role granting them permissions for different tools in the Developer Portal. You can create additional roles, but the default roles are as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>
							<strong>Role</strong>
						</th>
						<th>
							<strong>Description</strong>
