			<p>The Store Settings page of the Dev Portal consists of two primary sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Product Configuration</strong>: Collects key details about your product, such as metadata, specifications, and other high-level information used to populate your store presence. To learn more, review the sections below.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Regions and Ratings</strong>: Contains your product's rating certificates and classifications as well as your intended regions for distribution. To learn more, review
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/regions-ratings">Manage Regions &amp; Ratings</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Completing both sections of the Store Settings page is required for all products distributed on the Epic Games Store.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Store Settings Tips</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the Store Settings page, the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/release-management#status-definitions">status</a>
					of both the Product Configuration and Regions and Ratings sections display for each sandbox to help you monitor the progress of your product through the publishing workflow.</li>
				<li>The Product Configuration and Regions and Ratings sections both contain multiple subsections that collect specific categories of information. When a subsection has been completed, a blue checkmark displays beside its name to indicate all required information has been provided.</li>
				<li>When editing a specific subsection, preview windows display to the left of each form. These previews provide an example of where your provided information and assets display in the storefront.</li>
				<li>For asset specifications and best practices, refer to the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="manage-product-configuration">Manage Product Configuration</h2>
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Store Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Product Configuration section, click
					<strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
				<li>Provide the
					<a href="#required-information">required</a>
					and
					<a href="#optional-information">optional</a>
					information as needed.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="required-information">Required Information</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5 id="product-details">Product details</h5>
			</div>
			<p>The Product Details section collects information for the About Game section of your Product Details Page (PDP) in the Epic Games Store. This section features the following fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Product login</strong>: Specify which logins are required to play the game.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Product logo</strong>: The primary logo for your product featured in the storefront. For asset specifications and best practices, review the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Product display name</strong>: The title of your product displayed to users in the storefront.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Short description</strong>: A simple and straightforward description of your product, this information may be used throughout the storefront as well as with SEO and sharing settings.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: Because the maximum length of this field is 280 characters across all languages, we recommend limiting English text to roughly 200 characters.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Genres</strong>: Select up to three genres that describe your product.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Features</strong>: Select all features supported by your product at the time of release. Do not include features that are not supported by the initial launch of your product. Additional features can be added in tandem with future releases as needed.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Accessibility</strong>: Select the appropriate accessibility components for your product. This field is not required.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Product icon</strong>: An icon used to represent your product in the Support-a-Creator program. This field is not required.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Supported languages</strong>: Specify the Text and Audio languages supported for your product. Only the Text field is required.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Legal Info</strong>: The legal footer and privacy policy for your product. Only the footer is required.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: If you do not have a privacy policy, it is recommended that you create a page on your site stating that this information is not currently available to promote transparency with users.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>User Support</strong>: Provide either a support page URL or email address for users to access if they require assistance or have questions about your product. Completing at least one of these fields is required.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Developer and Publisher</strong>: The name of the developer and publisher of the product.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h5 id="specifications">Specifications</h5>
			</div>
			<p>The Specifications section is used to specify the platforms supported by your product (i.e., Windows and Mac) and the recommended technical requirements for an optimal user experience. As this information may change during development, review these details to confirm their accuracy prior to submitting your product for review.</p>
			<p>To specify the platforms supported by your product, select the appropriate tab at the top of the Edit Specifications screen and enable the
				<strong>My Product Supports this OS toggle</strong>. Once enabled, you can proceed to complete the relevant specification fields for your product. This information can also be pulled from the active binary associated with the artifact for your base product offer.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Only enable the platforms that are supported by your product at the time of its initial release on the Epic Games Store. Do not include platforms that are slated for future support. Additional platforms can be added in tandem with future releases as needed.</li>
				<li>You cannot set platform information for
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers">offer types</a>
					without an associated artifact, such as editions, season passes, or consumables. Instead, these offers use the platforms assigned to your base product. To ensure your offers without artifacts are assigned the appropriate platforms, you must promote these offers to the Stage sandbox any time you update the platforms assigned to your base product and push your product to Staging.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="optional-information">Optional Information</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5 id="social-media">Social media</h5>
			</div>
			<p>In the Social Media section, provide links to any social media pages available for your product. This information displays in the Follow Us section of your Product Details Page in the storefront.</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="banner">Banner</h5>
			</div>
			<p>The Banner displays on your Product Details Page and can be used to emphasize key phases of your go-to-market planning, such as beta or early access programs or in-game events.</p>
			<p>To add a banner to your productâ€™s storefront presence, enable the toggle at the top of the Edit Banner screen. You can then proceed to provide the relevant details for your banner content as needed.</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="theming">Theming</h5>
			</div>
			<p>By default, Product Detail Pages use the recommended Epic Games Store color palette. If desired, you can change this color palette through the Theming section. Themes can be set for both dark and light modes.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>At the top of the Theming screen,</li>
				<li>Select either the
					<strong>Dark Mode</strong>
					or
					<strong>Light Mode</strong>
					tab.</li>
				<li>In the Accent Color field, set your desired color. This color is used to highlight various elements of your Product Display Page, such as buttons.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: As best practice, it is recommended that the accent color sufficiently contrasts with the selected color theme as per Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the Color Themes section, select one of the available presets.</li>
				<li>In the preview to the left, review how the selected colors display on the storefront.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Click Save Changes</strong>
					to finalize your selections.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Color options you select for a specific mode (i.e., dark mode) are not inherited by the other mode. Dark and light modes must be updated separately.</p>
