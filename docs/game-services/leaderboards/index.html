			<p>The
				<strong>Leaderboards Interface</strong>
				gives developers using
				<strong>Epic Online Services</strong>
				(EOS) the ability to rank scores from their entire player base, so that players can compete with their friends or other players worldwide for the top score. Each game can support multiple leaderboards, collecting scores from different sources, and ranking them with different scoring modes.</p>
			
			<!-- -->
			<p>To access the Leaderboards Interface, acquire an
				<code>EOS_HLeaderboards</code>
				handle through the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
				function,
				<code>EOS_Platform_GetLeaderboardsInterface</code>. All Leaderboards Interface functions require this handle as their first parameter. You must ensure that the
				<code>EOS_HPlatform</code>
				handle is ticking in order for callbacks to trigger when operations complete.</p>
			<div>
				<p>The Leaderboard Interface sets up and manages leaderboards, but does not populate them with score data. Instead, leaderboards draw on data that the
					<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-stats-interface">Stats Interface</a>
					creates and maintains.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="creating-leaderboards">Creating Leaderboards</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Before you can access a leaderboard in-game, you must use the
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal">Developer Portal</a>
				to set up the stats that your leaderboard will track (see the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-stats-interface">Stats Interface</a>
				for more information), and define the leaderboard itself. Defining the leaderboard involves specifying:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The stat (or score) that the leaderboard tracks</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The method the leaderboard uses to rank players</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The starting and ending time for the leaderboard's overall lifespan</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have set up your stats and leaderboards, you can access them through the EOS SDK.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="stats-and-milestones">Stats and Milestones</h3>
			</div>
			<p>EOS Leaderboards are driven by our EOS Stats system. Each leaderboard uses a specific stat as the score that it tracks. See the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-stats-interface">Stats Interface</a>
				for more information.</p>
			<p>The EOS Leaderboards interface supports querying data for ranked, worldwide data and unranked friend data. Any stat in our system can be used as a friend, clan, or other group-based leaderboard and are viewed by simply querying individual playersâ€™ stats. Global leaderboards, on the other hand, require specific configuration. For scalability reasons, we limit both the number of global leaderboards you can have and the number of actual entries for the leaderboard we track. We do not track the entire global leaderboard, we simply keep track of the top 1000 (+ 1000 overflow) scores. We keep an extra 1000 entries because a developer may choose to remove certain entries from the leaderboard (for cheating, smurfing, privacy opt-out, or any other reason) so we keep extra values to fill out the top 1000 after those are removed. While the decision to only track the top 1000 entries does mean the majority of players will not see themselves on the leaderboard, we believe this to be good as global leaderboards only provide value for the top players. Friends leaderboards and other small, closed groups provide a lot more interactivity and value for players, giving them goals they can reasonably accomplish with meaningful feedback.</p>
			<p>Each leaderboard references a number of Stats milestones in order to bin Stat aggregations necessary to accurately compute leaderboard state. The number of leaderboards a single user can have is a function of how many Stats milestones a given user account is allowed to contain. The following table describes this function per leaderboard type (of which, only one type is currently supported):</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Leaderboard Type</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th># of Milestones Reference</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Singleton Leaderboard</td>
						<td>Leaderboard defined by a single aggregation window (start / end timestamp pair).</td>
						<td>2</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>When creating a leaderboard, milestones will either be referenced (read: reused) or created relative to the set of existing milestones defined by/for the user. For example, consider a Singleton Leaderboard which is defined to rank players between 08:00 - 16:00 on 10/31 over the
				<code>stat total_apples_collected</code>
				(SUM). Creating this leaderboard, assuming no milestones currently exist, would create the following milestones:</p>

			<p>Stats produced for

			<p>To highlight milestone reuse, consider next that we have another stat,
				<code>total_pumpkins_collected</code>, that we want a second Singleton Leaderboard for over this same time period.  Creating this new leaderboard will reference / reuse the same milestones created for the
				<code>total_apples_collected</code>
				and not further reduce the number of milestones available.</p>

				<h3 id="scoring-methods">Scoring Methods</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The Leaderboards Interface features multiple scoring methods to accommodate different kinds of games or ranking systems. Your leaderboard can calculate and rank scores according to a
				<strong>score aggregation type</strong>. You must use the same aggregation type for your leaderboard as is used by the stat that is assigned to it. The available score aggregation types are as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Score Aggregation Type</th>
						<th>Leaderboard Behavior</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_LSA_Min</code>
						</td>
						<td>The leaderboard uses the player's lowest reported score. The player with the lowest score holds the number one position.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_LSA_Max</code>
						</td>
						<td>The leaderboard uses the player's highest reported score. The player with the highest score holds the number one position.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_LSA_Sum</code>
						</td>
						<td>The leaderboard adds up every score each player reports. The player with the highest total score holds the number one position.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_LSA_Latest</code>
						</td>
						<td>The leaderboard uses the player's most recent reported score. The player with the highest score holds the number one position.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<div role="alert">
				<div></div>
				<div>
					<p>Usage of
						<code>EOS_LSA_Latest</code>
						for leaderboards can result in volatile leaderboard entries. For example, consider a
						<code>Latest</code>
						stat which tracks the number of objects collected for a level. While on a previous run, a player can perform well enough to be placed on a leaderboard for this stat. A subsequent play through of the level could result in worse performance and result in the player being removed from the leaderboard. In general, we do not encourage leaderboard usage with status defined with
						<code>EOS_LSA_Latest</code>
						unless using it to control their stat values/aggregations directly.  For example, a leaderboard containing a custom computed ELO by player. When using LATEST leaderboards it is important note that:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Leaderboards only retain aggregations for the top 2000 entries and only allow the top 1000 rankings to be viewable.  Values associated with players ranked 2001 and up are not retained by the system.  In order for such a player to be ranked onto a leaderboard, a stat must be emitted (or remitted) for that user.</li>
						<li>LATEST stat values which vary wildly between emissions result in poor player experiences relative to (1).  The ideal stat is one whose value is monotonic per player over time.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In addition, you will need to provide the name of the stat that the leaderboard will use as the score value.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="accessing-leaderboard-information">Accessing Leaderboard Information</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To access leaderboard information, you will need the leaderboard's ID, which is the same as the leaderboard's name in the Developer Portal. You can get these from the Developer Portal and add them into your game directly, or you can query the EOS SDK for a list of all leaderboards associated with your game. To do this, call
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_QueryLeaderboardDefinitions</code>
				with an
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_QueryLeaderboardDefinitionsOptions</code>
				struct initialized with the following information:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>ApiVersion</code>
						</td>
						<td>
							<code>EOS_LEADERBOARDS_QUERYLEADERBOARDDEFINITIONS_API_LATEST</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>StartTime</code>
						</td>
						<td>An optional POSIX timestamp for the leaderboard's start time, or
							<code>EOS_LEADERBOARDS_TIME_UNDEFINED</code>
						</td>
					</tr>

						<td>
							<code>EndTime</code>
						</td>
						<td>An optional POSIX timestamp for the leaderboard's end time, or
							<code>EOS_LEADERBOARDS_TIME_UNDEFINED</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Once this operation completes, your callback, of type
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardDefinitionsCompleteCallback</code>, will run with an
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardDefinitionsCompleteCallbackInfo</code>
				structure indicating success or failure. On success, the local cache will contain the list of leaderboards meeting your criteria. You can then use
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_GetLeaderboardDefinitionCount</code>
				to see how many leaderboard definitions the system found, and call
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardDefinitionByIndex</code>
				to get a copy of each leaderboard. If you already know the ID of a specific leaderboard that you expect is in the list, you can instead call
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardDefinitionByLeaderboardId</code>
				to get a copy of that board's definition.</p>
			<p>When calling
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardDefinitionByIndex</code>, pass in an
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardDefinitionByIndexOptions</code>
				structure initialized as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Value</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>

						<td>
							<code>EOS_LEADERBOARDS_COPYLEADERBOARDDEFINITIONBYINDEX_API_LATEST</code>

			<p>In either case, you will receive a copy of the information that defines the leaderboard (type
				<a href="/docs/api-ref/structs/eos-leaderboards-definition">EOS_Leaderboards_Definition</a>). When you no longer need this information, release it by calling
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_LeaderboardDefinition_Release</code>.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="retrieving-leaderboard-data">Retrieving Leaderboard Data</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Typically, players will want to view leaderboard data for the entire world, or just for their friends. The Leaderboards Interface provides separate querying methods to support these two ways to retrieve the data.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="retrieving-ranked-worldwide-data">Retrieving Ranked Worldwide Data</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To view a leaderboard's worldwide rankings, call
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_QueryLeaderboardRanks</code>

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>When the operation completes, your callback, of type
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardRanksCompleteCallback</code>, will run with an
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardRanksCompleteCallbackInfo</code>
				data structure that indicates success or failure. On success, the EOS SDK cache will contain the data you requested. You can find the number of records by calling
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_GetLeaderboardRecordCount</code>, and get copies of individual records with
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardRecordByIndex</code>. If you want the record for a specific user, and you have that user's ID, you can call
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardRecordByUserId</code>. Both of thee functions return a copy of a cached record in the form of an
				<a href="/docs/api-ref/structs/eos-leaderboards-leaderboard-record">EOS_Leaderboards_LeaderboardRecord</a>. Release these copies with
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_LeaderboardRecord_Release</code>
				once you no longer need them.</p>

				<h3 id="retrieving-unranked-friend-data">Retrieving Unranked Friend Data</h3>
			</div>
			<p>If you want to show a player the score records for their friends, use
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_QueryLeaderboardUserScores</code>. Call this function with an

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<div>
				<p>Scores that you collect in this way will be sorted according to your specification, but do not come from, or require, a leaderboard. These scores will have no global ranking. The
					<code>StatInfo</code>
					field includes both the stat you wish to compare and the ranking method you want to use relative to the other user scores retrieved in the query.</p>
			</div>
			<p>After the operation finishes, your callback, of type
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardUserScoresCompleteCallback</code>, will run with an
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_OnQueryLeaderboardUserScoresCompleteCallbackInfo</code>
				data structure that indicates success or failure. If the call succeeds, the cache will contain ordered records of your friends' scores. You can get the number of records available with the
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_GetLeaderboardUserScoreCount</code>
				function, and use
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardUserScoreByIndex</code>
				to retrieve scores by index, or
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardUserScoreByUserId</code>
				to retrieve them by user ID. In either case, you will receive a copy of the appropriate
