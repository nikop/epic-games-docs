			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="1154---2022-nov-16">1.15.4 - 2022-nov-16</h2>
			</div>
			<p>This release includes improvements across multiple interfaces, as well as extra support for game consoles.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ecom</strong>
				We have added a new EOS SDK API to the Ecom Interface:
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-ecom-query-entitlement-token">EOS_Ecom_QueryEntitlementToken</a>. It supports token-based verification of consumable items in your game (that is items which have limited persistence, decreasing a "use count" each time a player uses the item in your game). Use this new API to generate a JWT in your game’s client code to pass to a server-side verification service, if you use one.</p>
			<p>For further information, see:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Token-based verification in the
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/services/ecom/ecom-quick-start#token-based-verification">Ecom Quickstart Guide</a>
					in the Epic Games Store documentation.</li>
				<li>The
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/services/ecom/ecom-overview">Ecom Interface</a>
					in the Epic Games Store documentation.</li>
				<li>The Ecom documention's section on
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis#verifying-the-entitlement-verification-token">entitlement token verification</a>
					in the EOS Web API Reference.
					<br>
					This has information on how to pass this data to your chosen verification service, either your own or a third-party verification service (TPV).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Lobbies and Sessions</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We have fixed a bug within Lobbies and Sessions so the following player limits are now correctly enforced:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>16 maximum concurrent lobbies per player.</li>
				<li>16 maximum concurrent sessions per player.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Peer-to-peer</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We have improved security and responsiveness during poor network conditions by using the
				<code>dcSCTP</code>
				Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) library implementation instead of
				<code>usrsctp</code>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: This change is backward compatible, but we recommend you upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible for security and performance reasons.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>SDK 1.15.4 updates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sony PlayStation</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added version support for Sony PlayStation 4 SDK 10.008.001.</li>
				<li>Added version support for Sony PlayStation 5 SDK 6.00.00.38.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when players joined or left lobbies with voice chat enabled, on PlayStation 5  .</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Microsoft Xbox</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added version support for Microsoft Xbox GDK 220602 (June 2022 QFE2).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Deprecations</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Anti-cheat</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The
				<code>AccountId</code>
				parameter in
				<code>EOS_AntiCheatServer_RegisterClientOptions</code>
				is deprecated.  We have introduced a new
				<code>EOS_ProductUserId UserId</code>
				parameter to replace it.
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				If your game servers do not yet securely receive the
				<code>EOS_ProductUserId</code>
				from game clients, we recommend that you use the EOS Game Services' Connect Interface
				<code>EOS Connect ID Tokens</code>
				to get the
				<code>EOS_ProductUserId</code>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>EOS Core</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We have removed the string
				<strong>OPTIONS</strong>
				from macros across the Player Data Storage Interface and Title Storage Interface to align with the standard EOS SDK naming convention (<code>EOS_&lt;system_type&gt;_&lt;function_name&gt;_API_LATEST</code>).
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				For backward compatibility, the deprecated macros are still present but we will remove them in a future version. We recommend replacing any deprecated macros that use the old naming convention, with macros that use the new naming convention.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="1153---2022-sep-19">1.15.3 - 2022-sep-19</h2>
			</div>
			<p>There are now two types of EOS SDK for Android:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>New</strong>: A static SDK which links with
					<code>libc++_static.a</code>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Existing</strong>: A dynamic SDK which links with
					<code>libc++_shared.so</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can use either the static SDK for Android or the dynamic SDK for Android.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="1152-and-11521---2022-aug">1.15.2 and 1.15.2.1 - 2022-aug</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The 1.15.2 release (and 1.15.2.1 update) includes added support for Apple silicon, anti-cheat and ecom updates, as well as updates to the EOS SDKs for consoles (EOS SDK for Microsoft Xbox, EOS SDK for Nintendo Switch), and numerous bug fixes.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>New Features</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The SDK now supports Apple silicon on Mac with a universal dylib.
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note:</strong>
							Easy Anti-Cheat currently does not support Apple silicon.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>From EOS SDK version 1.15.2 onwards, the EOS SDK is pinned to two release versions of a console platform's SDK (Microsoft’s Xbox SDKs, Sony’s PlayStation SDKs, and Nintendo’s Switch SDKs, for example), where applicable. These two console platform versions are:
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>The console platform SDK's latest release version.</li>
						<li>The console platform SDK's previous release version.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Anti-Cheat updates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>There is one new Anti-cheat feature:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the
					<code>anticheat_integritytool.cfg</code>
					configuration file, you can now configure settings for your game client, such as the maximum number of active instances of your game allowed on a player’s machine.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are three additional improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The anti-cheat bootstrapper no longer caches its resources onto a player’s machine’s hard disk.</li>
				<li>On Windows, the anti-cheat bootstrapper now displays your game executable’s icon in the taskbar. If you add a custom icon in the
					<code>~/&lt;game root&gt;/ EasyAntiCheat</code>
					directory, it overwrites the default icon.</li>
				<li>The anti-cheat integrity tool now has more usage samples. You can see them by running
					<code>anticheat_integritytool.exe --help</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Ecom updates</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have added two new fields,
					<code>ReleaseDate</code>
					and
					<code>EffectiveDate</code>, to
					<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOffer</code>, which you can use to inform players when an offer will become available for purchase.</li>
				<li>We have introduced two new APIs to the Ecom Interface:
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>EOS_Ecom_GetLastRedeemedEntitlementsCount</code>
							to fetch the number of entitlements that were redeemed during the last
							<code>EOS_Ecom_RedeemEntitlements</code>
							call.</li>
						<li>
							<code>EOS_Ecom_CopyLastRedeemedEntitlementByIndex</code>
							to fetch a redeemed entitlement ID by a given index.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Deprecation Notices</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We have deprecated the
					<code>PurchasedCount</code>
					field from
					<code>EOS_Ecom_CatalogOffer</code>, which now always returns 0. Do not use this field anymore.
					<!-- -->
					<ul>
						<li>In previous versions of the SDK
							<code>PurchasedCount</code>
							is 0 unless a
							<code>PurchaseLimit</code>
							is configured on the offer. This behavior is not guaranteed and we recommend no longer using this field and upgrading to the latest SDK.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>SDK 1.15.2 and SDK 1.15.2.1 Updates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>This SDK release has some notable updates and bug fixes across several major features. See the
				<em>SDK Changelog</em>
				in the
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">Developer Portal</a>
				for a full list, the following are highlights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Console platforms</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>EOS_Platform_Create</code>
							now correctly detects pre-SDK 1.15 header files and sets the default
							<code>NetworkStatus</code>
							to
							<code>EOS_NS_Online</code>
							on all platforms. This resolves a backwards compatibility issue on consoles.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Sony PlayStation</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added version support for PS4 SDK 9.008.001 and PS5 SDK 4.000.00.31.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added version support for Nintendo Switch SDK 14.3.0 and retained support for Nintendo Switch SDK 13.3.2.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Microsoft Xbox</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added version support for Xbox GDK 220301 and retained support for Xbox GDK 211001.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Apple macOS</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed an issue where the Dev Auth Tool and anti-cheat bootstrapper didn't open.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Samples</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>iOS and Android samples now include example use of the SDK suspend / resume and network connect / disconnect APIs introduced in SDK 1.15.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Overlay</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>If you disable the Epic Online Services overlay in your game, or if it is not installed, Auth Interface authentication uses a system browser to enable players to sign in.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="1151---2022-jul-01">1.15.1 - 2022-jul-01</h2>
			</div>
			<p>We deprecated
				<code>EOS_ECT_STEAM_APP_TICKET</code>
				for use with
				<code>EOS_Auth_Login</code>
				and replaced it with
				<code>EOS_ECT_STEAM_SESSION_TICKET</code>.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="115---2022-jun-16">1.15 - 2022-jun-16</h2>
			</div>
			<p>This release includes new crossplay features, Anti-Cheat updates, updates to the console versions of the SDK (Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch), new voice volume control API, and numerous bug fixes. It also contains a few breaking changes required to enable these new features and updates.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Crossplay</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The SDK now offers seamless crossplay on PC: you can use crossplay to unify your players and your matchmaking pools across Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
			<p>Its main features are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use new Friends Interface APIs to enable players to make friend invites directly, and make connecting and playing together more streamlined.</li>
				<li>Steam players can jump into a game without emails or passwords; the SDK and EOS back-end services create an Epic Games Account for them under the hood and link it to their Steam account.</li>
				<li>Steam and Epic Games Store friends are now displayed side-by-side in the Epic Social Overlay on Steam, so players can see all friends in a single list.</li>
				<li>The in-game overlay handles Epic Account Services authentication and account linking so players stay in your game and are not redirected to an external browser.</li>
				<li>With the new self-updating redistributable, players experience new features and improvements to the Epic Social Overlay without you making changes to your build.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Crossplay is not a new interface or new overlay; we implemented crossplay in our existing features. You can find out more in the documentation on
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/crossplay/crossplay-across-platforms">Crossplay across platforms</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Anti-cheat updates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>There are three new Anti-Cheat features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Anti-cheat peer-to-peer mode now supports cross-platform play between PC and console users.</li>
				<li>In the configuration file you can now configure settings for your game client, such as the maximum number of active instances of your game allowed on a player’s machine.</li>
				<li>We replaced the client-side
					<code>EOS_AntiCheatClient_PollStatus</code>
					with a callback function which you can access through
					<code>EOS_AntiCheatClient_AddNotifyClientIntegrityViolated</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are three additional improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Better error logging.</li>
				<li>The Anti-Cheat bootstrapper: its binary (executable file) is now inside a bundle, it no longer caches its resources onto a player’s machine’s hard disk, and  on Windows, it now displays your game executable’s icon in the taskbar.</li>
				<li>The Anti-Cheat integrity tool now has more usage samples.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We deprecated
				<code>EOS_AntiCheatClient_RegisterPeerOptions AccountID</code>
				and replaced it with
				<code>PeerProductUserId</code>.</p>
			<p>We fixed 6 bugs, including fixing an issue where players could cheat to avoid detection.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Breaking Changes</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Core</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Breaking Change</strong>: All games must now call
							<code>EOS_Platform_SetApplicationStatus</code>
							and
							<code>EOS_Platform_SetNetworkStatus</code>. We added these APIs to the Platform Interface. They inform the SDK when the game gets suspended and resumed, and when the network connectivity state of the local system changes.  You can use two related APIs to check these statuses, these are optional.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Authentication</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Breaking Change</strong>: On Windows, the
							<code>EOS_LCT_AccountPortal</code>
							and
							<code>EOS_LCT_ExternalAuth</code>
							login types now require the EOS redistributable installed and your game must launch with the EOS bootstrapper.
							<!-- -->
							<ul>
								<li>For more information, see the documentation on
									<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/crossplay/redistributable-installer">Redistributable installer</a>.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>C# SDK</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Breaking Change</strong>: We changed most reference types (classes) to value types (structs), giving significant performance gains. You must now use the
							<code>ref</code>
							keyword when you pass options structs in API calls and use info structs in callbacks.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>SDK 1.15 Updates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>This SDK release has some notable updates and bug fixes across several major features. See the SDK Changelog in the Developer Portal for a full list, the following are highlights:</p>

							<code>EOS_GetVersion</code>
							to contain the platform it relates to.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Voice</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Added an audio volume control API (<code>EOS_RTCAudio_UpdateParticipantVolume</code>) that extends (and replaces) the existing volume control.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Developer Auth Tool</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The tool now persists the provided port and credentials, and refreshes credentials when it’s run for long durations.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>The Social Overlay</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The Social Overlay now shows a player ALL their Epic friends. This includes Epic friends who have never played the game which a player is playing.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Known Issues</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Core</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>iOS and Android samples are currently not updated with examples of the new suspend / resume and network connect / disconnect APIs.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>

				<strong>Custom Invites</strong>
				The Custom Invites Interface is out!</p>
			<p>Custom Invites allows titles to allow titles to use the built-in Epic Online Service (EOS) Connect messaging to send and receive invites.</p>
			<p>This system should be considered viable in the following cases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Titles that already have an existing and robust invitation system</li>
				<li>Titles where users want send and receive invites through the Epic Account Services Social Overlay</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<p>For this release, the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/voice">Voice interface</a>
				is a
				<strong>Preview</strong>
				service. You can use the Voice interface to create and manage voice chats among your users. And with the Voice-Lobbies integration, you can have the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/lobbies">Lobbies interface</a>
				handle the room management and authorization.</p>
			<p>Be sure to check out the sample projects for
				<a href="/docs/game-services/voice/voice-sample">C</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/game-services/voice/voice-sample-c-sharp">C#</a>
				as well!</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Web APIs</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Although we’ve had REST APIs for the
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/authentication">Auth interface</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/ecom-web-apis">Ecom interface</a>, we are building out our Web APIs to support more common use cases for web and backend services.</p>
			<p>We still recommend using the EOS SDK to interact with your game clients and servers, but check out the
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/web-api-introduction">Web API Introduction</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/web-api-ref">reference</a>
				for the HTTP API options as well!</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Dark Theme</strong>
			</p>
			<p>You can switch between dark and light theme in our documentation! Use the switch near the bottom of the panel navigation to change your view.</p>

				<strong>Easy Anti-Cheat</strong>
			</p>
			<p>For this release, the Anti-Cheat interfaces are a
				<strong>Preview</strong>
				service.</p>
			<p>You can use the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/anti-cheat">Anti-Cheat interfaces</a>
				(also known as
				<strong>Easy Anti-Cheat</strong>) to help reduce cheating in online multiplayer play.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>itch.io as an Identity Provider</strong>
			</p>
			<p>You can use
				<strong>itch.io</strong>
				as an
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management">identity provider</a>
				for your products.</p>
			<p>Available identity providers are platforms where Epic Online Services can link your users’ accounts to enable sharing their data across the different platforms and participate in cross-platform features like matchmaking. Identity providers must be configured in your Developer Portal and work with the Connect interface.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="111---2021-apr-07">1.11 - 2021-apr-07</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>Sanctions interface</strong>
			</p>
			<p>You can use the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/sanctions-interface">Sanctions interface</a>
				to manage the punitive actions taken against your users, such as temporary or permanent bans.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Reports interface</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The
				<a href="/docs/game-services/reports-interface">Reports interface</a>
				stores in-game user behavior reports that you can query to view the details of reported user behaviors, such as cheating, verbal abuse, offensive profiles, and so on. You can then use this information with the Sanctions interface to help conduct any punitive actions.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Google as an Identity Provider</strong>
			</p>
			<p>You can use Google as an
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management">identity provider</a>
				for your products.</p>
			<p>Available identity providers are platforms where Epic Online Services can link your users’ accounts to enable sharing their data across the different platforms and participate in cross-platform features like matchmaking. Identity providers must be configured in your Developer Portal and work with the Connect interface.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Artifacts</strong>
			</p>
			<p>By mapping deployments with Games Store
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/services/launcher-invites">artifacts</a>, you can add lobby and session invite functionality to the Epic Games Launcher to friends online, even if they are not signed into the game. This gives your players another way to connect with other players on their Epic Games Store friends list across platforms.</p>
