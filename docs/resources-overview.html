			<p>Epic's developer resources include a set of free services and tools which software developers can use to add network-based functionality to video games, and storefront distribution for video games.</p>
			<p>There are three sets of resources:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Epic Games Store (storefront distribution and games-store services)</li>
				<li>Epic Online Services (EOS)</li>
				<li>Kids Web Services (KWS)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sets of resources have associated tools to configure and manage them with your game: the Epic Games Developer Portal (known as the "Developer Portal"), the KWS Developer Portal, SDKs and APIs.</p>

				<strong>Modular</strong>
				<br>
				The resources are modular, so you can use them individually, or combine as many as you need.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Platform Agnostic</strong>
				<br>
				Epic Online Services (EOS) and Kids Web Services (KWS) are games-platform agnostic and games-engine agnostic. You can add them to your game whatever games platform your game clients run on, and whatever game engine you use for development, or if you use no game engine at all.
				<br>
				They are also storefront agnostic, so you can use them whatever storefront you make your game available on.
				<br>
				(Note that Epic Games Store's storefront distribution and games-store services are for games which run on PC: Windows or macOS.)</p>
