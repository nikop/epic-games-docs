			<p>The Epic Games Store welcomes developers to release their products for Early Access. This allows you to make your product available to users while it is still in development.</p>
			<p>Some studios leverage Early Access to collect and incorporate user feedback, evolving their product by focusing on the features and functionality that most interest their users. While it is up to you to define what Early Access means for your product, releasing for Early Access can offer an iterative approach to building, testing, improving, and ultimately launching a complete, high-quality game to users.</p>
			<p>To release your product for Early Access, follow the guidelines below. These configurations are
				<strong>required</strong>
				in order to release your product for Early Access. When you submit your product for review, the Epic Games Store team will confirm these requirements have been met.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="early-access-requirements">Early Access Requirements</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To release your product for Early Access, your store presence must feature the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Logo and key art</li>
				<li>Early Access tag</li>
				<li>FAQ page</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This information helps users make informed decisions by setting expectations for your product while it is under active development.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="upload-logo-and-key-art">Upload Logo and Key Art</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The logo and primary offer images you provide for your product must clearly indicate that it is available as an Early Access release.</p>
