			<p>To get up and running with the Epic Online Services (EOS), integrate the EOS SDK with your game, so your game can access EOS services. To do this, you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up an Epic Games account and organization in the Developer Portal.</li>
				<li>Download the EOS SDK (available in C and C#).</li>
				<li>Integrate the Platform Interface into your game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This document gives guidance on how to do this together with information on the sample code which comes with the SDK download.</p>
			<p>There are also introduction resources, including introduction blogs, FAQs, and some information on the EOS game engine plugins for Unreal Engine and Unity. For more information on these see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/get-started-resources">Get Started Resources</a>
				page.</p>

				<h2 id="get-started-steps">Get Started Steps</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="before-you-begin---system-requirements">Before You Begin - System Requirements</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Check the following requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The system requirements for your development environment and your game-client's runtime environment in the
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/system-requirements">System Requirements</a>
					page.</li>
				<li>A list of the host addresses that you need to access to use EOS SDK in the
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/firewall-considerations">Firewall Considerations</a>
					page.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-1---set-up-an-epic-games-account-and-organization">Step 1 - Set up an Epic Games Account and Organization</h3>
			</div>
			<p>You use the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>) to set up your game to use EOS services, to configure the services, and to access the SDK download.</p>
			<p>In the Developer Portal, you associate your Epic Games account with an "organization", which is your company or business. Each game is known as a "product". An organization can have multiple products.</p>
			<p>Every game (<strong>product</strong>
				in the Developer Portal) has:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>A product ID</strong>
					- a unique identifier for your game.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>One or more sandbox IDs</strong>
					- different named environments for your game's implementation. Example use: you have three different sandboxes to separate the development, testing, and production versions of a game's implementation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every sandbox has:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>One or more deployment IDs</strong>
					- different iterations of your game's implementation within a sandbox. Example use: every deployment in your testing sandbox is either a beta test version or a release candidate, and every deployment in your production sandbox is a release version.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The EOS SDK uses these to identify your game with the EOS services.</p>
			<p>For more information about how to use product management tools when setting up an account, see the documentation on
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/product-management">Product, Sandbox, and Deployment IDs</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="step-2---download-the-eos-sdk">Step 2 - Download the EOS SDK</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Once you have set up your organization and products in the Developer Portal, you can download the EOS SDK from the Developer Portal.</p>
			<p>To get the SDK download, on the Developer Portal home page, click
				<strong>Download SDK</strong>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				To use Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK, your local network, router, and firewall must allow access to specific host addresses. For a complete list of these host addresses, see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/firewall-considerations">Firewall Considerations</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="eos-sdk-download-types">EOS SDK Download Types</h4>
			</div>
			<p>There are different types of SDK downloads to use, depending on which platform your game client runs on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Windows, macOS, Linux</strong>
					- the EOS SDK in C, and the EOS SDK in C#.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Mobile</strong>
					- the EOS SDK for iOS, and the EOS SDK for Android.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Consoles</strong>
					- there are EOS SDK downloads for game consoles in C, and in C#.
					<br>
					The SDK downloads for consoles are only available to developers approved by the platform holders and approved by Epic Games.
					<br>
					The platform holders are: Microsoft (Xbox One, Xbox Series X), Sony (PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5), and Nintendo (Switch).</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="access-to-the-sdk-for-consoles">Access to the SDK for Consoles</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To get access to the SDK downloads for consoles and associated documentation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Go to the Developer Portal at
					<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>, click
					<strong>SDK &amp; RELEASE NOTES</strong>, and click
					<strong>Request access</strong>
					at the bottom for guidance on applying for console developer access from the platform holders.</li>
				<li>Once you have platform-holder approval, you can apply to Epic Games using the
					<em>Console Developer Request for Epic Online Services</em>
					form, which is at
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/console-access-request">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="whats-in-the-eos-sdk-download">What's in the EOS SDK Download</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The EOS SDK download has the following directories:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<strong>Directory</strong>
						</td>
						<td colspan="3">
							<strong>Content</strong>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>
							<code>/Samples</code>

						<td colspan="3">Sample projects implementations demonstrating how the EOS SDK works.</td>

						<td colspan="3">The libraries and header files you use in your game code to integrate the EOS SDK with your game so your game can use EOS services.</td>

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>We recommend looking at the samples in the
				<code>samples</code>
				directory: they demonstrate some of the platform's features. There is a list of the documentation which accompanies each sample on the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/samples">EOS SDK Samples</a>
				page.</p>

				<h4 id="eos-sdk-further-information">EOS SDK Further Information</h4>

					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/working-with-the-eos-sdk/conventions-and-limitations">Working with the SDK: Conventions and Limitations</a>.</li>
				<li>The EOS SDK in C# has some implementation differences to the EOS SDK in C. If you are using C# and if you are using Unity for games development, also see

			<div>
				<h3 id="step-3---integrate-the-platform-interface">Step 3 - Integrate the Platform Interface</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To use EOS services in your game, you integrate interfaces. There is an interface for each service (outlined in the
				<a href="#interface-functionality">Interface Functionality</a>
				section below).</p>
			<p>The first interface you integrate into your game is the Platform Interface. It holds the handles you need to access every other interface and keep them running: when your game starts up, you initialize the SDK and get a handle to the Platform Interface.</p>
			<p>Find out more about this in the
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				The Platform Interface is not the same as the games platforms your game clients run on. The documentation refers to these game platforms as “EOS SDK on Platforms”.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="interface-functionality">Interface Functionality</h4>
			</div>
			<p>For an overview of the functionality provided by each interface, see the following documentation:</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="eos-game-services">EOS Game Services</h5>
			</div>
			<p>The interfaces for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Multiplayer</strong>: lobbies, p2p, sessions, stats, title storage, voice chat</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Player progression</strong>: metrics, stats, achievements, leaderboards</li>
