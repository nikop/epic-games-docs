				<em>Image: The Achievements tab of the Social Overlay, from Fall Guys (EOS SDK 1.15).</em>
			</p>
			<p>A player can access the Achievements tab of the Social Overlay if you have integrated either Epic Games Store achievements or Epic Online Services achievements into your game.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				If you integrate both Epic Games Store achievements and Epic Online Services achievements into your game, players only see Epic Games Store achievements on the Achievements tab of the Social Overlay.</p>
			<p>On the Achievements tab of the Social Overlay, a player can see a list of achievements in your game (that aren't hidden from the player), the progress they have made to complete all available achievements, and details on what the achievements are.</p>
			<p>For more information on using achievements, see the documentation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/docs/game-services/achievements">Achievements Interface</a>
					for Epic Online Services achievements.</li>

			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="what-is-displayed">What is displayed?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A player can use the Achievements tab to see the following details on the achievements in your game:</p>
			<p>
				<strong>List of Achievements</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Achievements are grouped in this order:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Completed:</strong>
					Achievements that the player has completed.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Locked:</strong>
					Achievements that the player can see, but has not completed.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Hidden:</strong>

			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Achievement Progress</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All achievements from your game.</li>
				<li>Player's total progress: the total number of completed achievements compared to the total number of achievements, progress measured in a percentage, and also represented by a progress bar.</li>
				<li>Player's complete achievements.</li>
				<li>If you integrate Epic Games achievements into your game then a player also sees their progress on each achievement (represented by a progress bar).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Achievement Detail</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Each achievement shows the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>

					<br>
					If you did not set the icon or it fails to load, the player sees a default icon.</li>
				<li>

					The title you set up for the achievement.
					<br>
					If the achievement is locked, then the player sees a locked symbol next to the title text.</li>
				<li>

				<li>
					<strong>Player's progress:</strong>
