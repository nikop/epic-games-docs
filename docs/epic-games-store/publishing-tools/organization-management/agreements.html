			<p>In order to distribute your
				<span>
					<span>product</span>
				</span>
				on the Epic Games Store, your
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/organization-management/manage-org">organization</a>
				must accept the appropriate agreements. Agreements can be completed by your organization owner or a team member with Agreements Management permissions (previously called Legal Management permissions). You cannot use the Epic Games Store publishing tools until this step is complete.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You must be 18 or older to accept the required agreements and distribute your product on the Epic Games Store. If your organization owner is unable to accept agreements on behalf of your legal entity,
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site for assistance.</li>
				<li>If Epic Games makes a major version update to the End User License agreement, the new agreement must be accepted in order for your organization to continue using the publishing tools. You will not be able to access the tools until this step is complete.</li>
				<li>When Epic Games updates a specific feature agreement that you have accepted, you will be notified when you next attempt to access the publishing tools. Your organization owner must accept the updated agreement in order to maintain use of the associated feature.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
