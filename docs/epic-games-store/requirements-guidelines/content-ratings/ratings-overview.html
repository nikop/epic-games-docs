			<p>The Epic Games Store does not require products to be rated by an official rating system in most scenarios. However, some regions, such as South Korea, require ratings in order to distribute products in those areas. Additionally, any product leveraging blockchain technology in any capacity must be rated in order to be published to the storefront.</p>
			<p>If your product has received a rating from an official rating system, it must be displayed on your product display page. Unrated products published to the Epic Games Store are treated as having the highest level maturity rating in each region the product is available.</p>

				ratings are legally required to distribute products in South Korea for any playable builds (including demo and early-access builds) that are available to the public.</p>
			<p>The process to obtain a GRAC rating varies between non-mature and mature titles. The distinction between these categories follows the
				<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/english/enforcement/ageratingsymbol.aspx">Game Industry Promotion Act (GRAC) guidelines</a>. The Epic Games Store has a dedicated team available to help you obtain the necessary ratings for distribution.</p>

			<p>In regions that do not require specific ratings, you may distribute your product on the Epic Games Store without a rating, if desired. However, please be aware that unrated products are treated as having the highest level maturity rating available for each region the game is distributed on the storefront.</p>
