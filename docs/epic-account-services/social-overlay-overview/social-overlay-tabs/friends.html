					<p>This documentation assumes that you install the Social Overlay with your game and initialize the EOS SDK when a player starts your game. For more information on how to install and initialize the Social Overlay, see the
						<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/sdk-integration">SDK Integration</a>
						documentation.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>When a player in your game opens the Social Overlay for the first time, they see the Friends tab. They can also navigate to the Friends tab if it is not open. The player can use the Friends tab to see a list of their friends.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="what-is-a-friend">What is a Friend?</h4>
			</div>
			<p>A player (Player 1) is a friend to another player (Player 2) if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Both players have an Epic Games account, or an account on a platform supported by the Social Overlay.</li>
				<li>Player 1 receives and accepts an invitation via the Social Overlay from Player 2 to join their friends list, or accepts an invitation on a platform supported by the Social Overlay.</li>
				<li>Neither player blocks the other player (EOS SDK 1.15 onwards only)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For more information on how to send an invite or block a player, see the sections below on each EOS SDK version.</p>
			<p>For a list of platforms supported by the Social Overlay, see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/technical-overview">Technical Overview</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<p>The player can also use the Friends tab, or Add Friends tab with EOS SDK 1.16 onwards, to search for other players that have an Epic Games account, see if their friends are online, and if they are playing the same game.</p>
