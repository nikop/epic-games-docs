			<p>The Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK has downloads in C# in addition to C. This page outlines some of the implementation differences between working with the EOS SDK in C# to working with the EOS SDK in C. While the core functionality remains the same regardless of the language you use, the SDK in C# differs in design in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The EOS SDK in C# adheres to C# best practices and follows an object-oriented approach. It uses handle objects rather than C-style handles to manage asynchronous operations.</li>
				<li>Naming conventions match typical C# patterns. For example, the
					<code>EOS_Auth_Login</code>
					in the EOS SDK in C is accessible in the EOS SDK in C# as
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Auth.AuthInterface.Login</code>.</li>
				<li>Data structures in the EOS SDK in C require macro-based API version numbers to ensure compatibility. These values are pre-populated in the EOS SDK in C#.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="eos-sdk-in-c-dependencies">EOS SDK in C# Dependencies</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To work with the EOS SDK in C#, you need the following installed in your development environment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>.NET Framework 3.5 or higher (or an API-compatible equivalent)</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong>
						Previous versions might work, but we have not tested them.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To work with the EOS SDK samples in C#, you need the following installed in your development environment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>.NET Core 3.1</li>
				<li>Visual Studio 2019 or higher</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See the main
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/system-requirements">System Requirements</a>
				page for full details of what your development environment needs.</p>
			<p>See the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/services-quick-start">EOS Get Started</a>

				<h2 id="implementing-the-sdk">Implementing the SDK</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Once you have set up your
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip product" tabindex="0" role="button">product</span>
				</span>
				and integrated the SDK in C#, you can begin writing code. You'll need to initialize the SDK, call its
				<code>Tick</code>
				method regularly to ensure that the SDK can execute and that callbacks can run, and shut it down when your application finishes.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="managing-the-sdks-life-cycle">Managing the SDK's Life Cycle</h3>
			</div>
			<p>There are three main parts of the SDK's life cycle: Initialization, Ticking (normal operation), and Shutdown.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="initialization">Initialization</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The
				<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
				is the entry point to the SDK, and you will need an instance of this interface to use EOS. To create one, call
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Initialize</code>
				with some basic information about your application, then call
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Create</code>
				with the values you have obtained from the Developer Portal to get an
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface</code>
				instance. Store this instance; you will need it to interact with the SDK. For example, to perform authentication, you first need an instance of
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Auth.AuthInterface</code>, and you can retrieve this by calling GetAuthInterface() on your
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterfac</code>e instance.</p>
			<div>
				<p>You can only initialize the SDK once; subsequent calls to
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Initialize</code>
					will return the
					<code>AlreadyInitialized</code>
					failure code. We recommend initializing the SDK when your application starts up and not releasing it until the application shuts down.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="ticking">Ticking</h4>
			</div>
			<p>In order for the SDK to operate, you must call
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Tick</code>
				on your Platform Interface instance regularly. These calls do not need to happen every frame, but should happen fairly often; one call every 100 milliseconds is considered reasonable, but you can adjust the exact frequency to your needs. SDK callbacks can only run when you call
				<code>Tick</code>, so all of your asynchronous operations depend on it.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="shutdown">Shutdown</h4>
			</div>
			<p>When you no longer need the SDK — generally, at application shutdown time — you can shut it down by calling
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Release</code>
				to release your Platform Interface instance, and then
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Shutdown</code>
				to complete the shutdown process. This process is final;
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Release</code>
				puts the SDK into a finalized state, and you cannot acquire another Platform Interface handle or reinitialize the SDK after that point. For this reason, we advise against shutting down the EOS SDK until application shutdown.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Some editor environments, including Unity, load external libraries like EOS during editor startup and do not unload them until the editor shuts down. In these cases, you should not call
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Release</code>
					or
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface.Shutdown</code>
					at the end of an in-editor play session, because you will be unable to initialize the SDK successfully in any future session without restarting the editor. In addition, because these editor environments use one continuous instance of the SDK, operations that began right before the end of a play session could finish and trigger callbacks in the following session.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Most callback data structures and some return values use
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Result</code>
				to convey the results of SDK operations. Make sure to use this to handle errors and ensure operations are performing as expected.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The SDK outputs useful debugging information through an internal interface. To enable this feature, set up
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Logging.LoggingInterface</code>
				as early as possible, preferably immediately after initializing the SDK, by calling
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Logging.LoggingInterface.SetLogLevel</code>
				with parameters indicating the level of detail you require, followed by
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Logging.LoggingInterface.SetCallback</code>
				with a callback function to receive log information. This feature can provide insight into internal operations and can help with identifying the causes of unexpected behaviors you may encounter.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="unmanaged-memory">Unmanaged Memory</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In the SDK in C, some APIs such as
				<code>EOS_Leaderboards_CopyLeaderboardDefinitionByIndex</code>
				pass out structs of data that must be manually released. In the SDK in C#, you don’t need to concern yourself with releasing these structs as they are automatically handled by the wrapper’s marshaling code.</p>
			<p>In the SDK in C, some APIs such as
				<code>EOS_Presence_CreatePresenceModification</code>
				pass out handles that let you set data in memory that is owned by the SDK library. These handles must be manually released. In the SDK in C#, these handles are represented by objects with an underlying type of
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Handle</code>, and contain functions that let you set the unmanaged data. They also contain a Release function that you must manually call when you are finished with it.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="custom-memory-delegates">Custom Memory Delegates</h3>
			</div>
			<p>On some platforms, such as consoles, the SDK requires you to implement your own allocate, reallocate, and release functions. Because the SDK will call these functions with very high frequency, it is highly performant for the SDK to be able to access them directly without being routed through delegates in managed code.</p>
			<p>You have the option to pass these functions into the SDK when initializing the platform with
				<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.InitializeOptions</code>. It is recommended that you:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a native library and implement the 3 memory functions,</li>
				<li>For each of the 3 memory functions, implement an export function that returns a pointer to the memory function,</li>
				<li>Before initializing the platform in C#, call the export functions, and set the returned IntPtr values to the options struct.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following sample code demonstrates the structure of what your native library may look like:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>And the following sample code demonstrates what the C# bindings may look like:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="the-eos-overlay">The EOS Overlay</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To use the
				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip EOS Overlay" tabindex="0" role="button">EOS Overlay</span>
				</span>
				in your game, complete the following before any graphics devices are created:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load the SDK library into memory</li>
				<li>Initialize with
					<a href="/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-initialize">EOS_Initialize</a>
				</li>
				<li>Create your platform with
					<a href="/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-platform-create">EOS_Platform_Create</a>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In Unity, one way you can achieve this is by creating a
				<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LowLevelNativePluginRenderingExtensions.html">low-level native rendering plugin</a>. At a minimum, you will need to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a native library with a name prefixed with
					<code>GfxPlugin</code>,</li>
				<li>Add an export function named
					<code>UnityPluginLoad(void*)</code>
					that loads the SDK library and invokes
					<a href="/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-initialize">EOS_Initialize</a>
					and
					<a href="/docs/api-ref/functions/eos-platform-create">EOS_Platform_Create</a>
					successfully,</li>
				<li>Add an export function to return the created platform interface handle back to C# when needed, where it can be used to construct a new instance of
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Platform.PlatformInterface</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<p>The EOS overlay is not supported in editor environments such as the Unity editor. It is recommended that you explicitly disable the overlay in editor environments to prevent unintended behavior.</p>
			</div>
			<p>As a best practice for Unity users,  we recommend that your standalone build controls the lifetime of the SDK inside a low-level native rendering plugin, and your editor build should exclude the plugin to control the lifetime of the SDK inside a MonoBehaviour with dynamic bindings.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Social Features, Authorization, and Purchasing (on Desktop)</strong>
				<br>
				You must integrate the EOS Overlay with your game to use these features. For more information, see the
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/sdk-integration">SDK Integration</a>
				documentation.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="dynamic-bindings">Dynamic Bindings</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Typically, the SDK in C# uses
				<code>extern DllImport</code>
				bindings. However, you may need to use dynamic bindings.</p>
			<p>To begin using dynamic bindings:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Define
					<code>EOS_DYNAMIC_BINDINGS</code>
				</li>
				<li>Dynamically load the SDK library and retrieve a library handle</li>
				<li>When the application session begins, call
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Bindings.Hook</code>
					to  pass in the library handle and function pointer loader delegate.</li>
				<li>When the application session ends, call
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Bindings.Unhook</code>
					and free the library to clean up.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For example, you may have the following extern functions defined on Windows:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>Then to begin using the SDK, load the library and hook the dynamic bindings with:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<p>When the application is finished, unhook the dynamic bindings and free the library with:</p>
			<div>
				<section>
					<pre>

					</pre>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Some platforms have platform specific APIs. These platforms have their own bindings class.</p>
				<p>To use platform specific APIs, you must hook the corresponding platform-specific bindings class,
					<strong>in addition to</strong>
					the base
					<code>Epic.OnlineServices.Bindings</code>
					class.</p>
			</div>
			<p>As of 1.12, the default behavior of the SDK in C# is to require dynamic bindings for editor environments such as the Unity editor. This is to enable on-demand loading and unloading of the SDK library, and allow the SDK to be initialized each time the game is run in the editor. More detailed sample code for
				<a href="#unity-eossdk-component">using dynamic bindings in Unity</a>
				is provided below.</p>
