				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Pages section of the Dev Portal allows you to manage the individual pages that comprise your product's store presence. These pages - the Product Home page, offer pages, and FAQ page - feature visual media, written content, and other details that describe your
				<span role="tooltip" aria-label="product">
					<span tabindex="0">product</span>
				</span>
				to users.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first action to complete for each new product is
					<a href="#configure-the-product-home-page">configuring the Product Home page</a>.</li>
				<li>Then, you can
					<a href="#publishing-a-page-for-an-offer">manage the pages for individual offers</a>
					associated with your product, such as demos, editions, or season passes.</li>
				<li>If needed, you can also
					<a href="#create-an-faq-page">create an FAQ page</a>. While FAQ pages are optional in most scenarios, they are required for certain types of products, such as those launched as Early Access titles.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="configure-the-product-home-page">Configure the Product Home Page</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Product Home page is the first page users see when reviewing your product on the Epic Games Store. The media assets and other content you provide should engage users and highlight the various elements of your product.</p>
			<p>When you first create your product in the Dev Portal, a Product Home page is automatically generated. Additional information is needed to tailor this page to your product.</p>
			<p>To configure your Product Home page, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product  &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Pages</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the table, click the
					<strong>Product Home</strong>
					option.</li>
				<li>On the Edit Page screen, provide the
					<a href="#mandatory-information">mandatory</a>
					and
					<a href="#optional-information">optional</a>
					information for your product, as needed.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: While not configurable from the Pages section, your Product Home page also displays information about your product's
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/ratings-overview">ratings</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="mandatory-information">Mandatory Information</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="carousel">Carousel</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Assets in the Carousel are the first items users engage with when visiting your store presence. Carousel media can include a variety of assets for users to scroll through while reviewing your product, such as videos, screenshots, key art, and other marketing materials.</p>
			<p>The Carousel is most effective when used as a way to highlight not only the art style of your product, but also the gameplay features and experiences users can expect. To best reach potential users, uploading at least one video to this section is recommended.</p>
			<p>For asset specifications and other guidelines, review the Carousel section of the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide#carousel">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="videos-and-closed-captioning">Videos and Closed Captioning</h4>
			</div>
			<p>When uploading a video asset to the Carousel, you have the option to upload a Closed Caption file to support accessibility for your video.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding closed captions for your video content is not required</li>
				<li>Closed captioning must be submitted as a .VTT file</li>
				<li>Closed caption files cannot exceed 4 MB</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="about">About</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Through the About section of your Product Home page, you can provide a detailed description of your product without the character limitations of the Short Description field.</p>
			<p>The About section can accommodate up to 12 blocks of content consisting of text and inline screenshots, gifs, or other images. Adding at least one text block is required.</p>
			<p>For asset specifications and other guidelines, review the About section of the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide#about-section--additional-images">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="optional-information">Optional Information</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="additional-images">Additional Images</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The Additional Images option allows you to further show off your product by uploading extra visual media to the bottom of your Product Home page. This media can include additional gameplay screenshots, art, or other marketing materials.</p>
			<p>While adding additional images is optional, uploading at least 1-6 assets is recommended.</p>
			<p>For asset specifications and other guidelines, review the Additional Images section of the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide#about-section--additional-images">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="social-preview">Social Preview</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The Social Preview option allows you to upload assets for use with social media posts. Social Preview assets are not displayed directly on the storefront and are instead used by 3rd-parties when linking to social media posts.</p>
			<p>For asset specifications and other guidelines, review the Social Preview section of the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/sales-and-marketing/marketing/storefront-media-guide#social-preview">Storefront Media Guide</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="localization">Localization</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To help your product reach a wide audience of global users, the Epic Games Store supports localization for over 15 languages. To learn more, review
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/localization">Localize Store Presence</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="publishing-a-page-for-an-offer">Publishing a Page for an Offer</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When you create an offer for your product, a page representing that offer is also created. These pages provide users with tailored information about each offer available.</p>
			<p>To configure an offer page, navigate to the Pages section and select the offer you wish to configure. Then, provide the appropriate
				<a href="#mandatory-information">mandatory</a>
				and
				<a href="#optional-information">optional</a>
				details for that offer.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note - Pages for Edition Offers</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Pages are automatically generated for Edition offers created after
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/whats-new/recent-updates#march-28-2023-release">March 28, 2023</a>. However, Edition offers created prior to this date do not have dedicated pages generated for them. If a page has not been auto-generated for one of your Edition offers, you can manually create one through the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product  &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Pages</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Create Page</strong>
					to the top right. Then, select
					<strong>Edition</strong>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: If you do not have any Edition offers without a page, this option does not display.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>From the list, select one of your available Edition offers. Then, click
					<strong>Create</strong>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: Only Edition offers without a dedicated page display in this list.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can then upload the appropriate
				<a href="#mandatory-information">mandatory</a>
				and
				<a href="#optional-information">optional</a>
				information for that edition. Repeat as needed for each Edition offer without a dedicated page.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="publishing-options">Publishing Options</h3>
			</div>
			<p>An offer page that has been published to the Live
				<span role="tooltip" aria-label="sandbox">
					<span tabindex="0">sandbox</span>
				</span>
				can exist in one of the following states:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enabled for early store discovery</li>
				<li>Pushed to Live sandbox but not yet available to users</li>
				<li>Released and available for purchase</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These states are fueled by the dates set for individual offers. To learn more, review the Dates section of
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers#dates">Manage Offers</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="enabled-for-early-store-discovery">Enabled for Early Store Discovery</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To publish a page for an offer prior to the release of your product, enable the
				<em>Early Store Discovery</em>
				option for that offer and provide a discoverability date.</p>
			<p>As best practice, we recommend that you publish your product offer pages as early as possible to gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Generate user interest in your product prior to release</li>
				<li>Boost awareness of your product’s availability on the Epic Games Store</li>
				<li>Allow users to add your product to their wishlist and receive notifications about your product</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Pages for offers with early store discovery enabled feature
				<em>Coming Soon</em>
				text in place of their
				<em>Buy Now</em>
				button. They can also display an estimated, exact, or unknown release date to users. Further, these products are included in the Coming Soon filter available on the Browse page of the Epic Games Store.</p>
			<p>To learn more about early store discovery, review the Dates section of
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers#dates">Manage Offers</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: If you set an early store discovery date on your offer, the Epic Games Store automatically associates the offer with an auto-generated
				<span role="tooltip" aria-label="artifact">
					<span tabindex="0">artifact</span>
				</span>. Note that you do not need to attach a
				<span role="tooltip" aria-label="binary">
					<span tabindex="0">binary</span>
				</span>
				to that artifact in order to publish the offer page as
				<em>Coming Soon</em>. To learn more, review
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-artifacts">Manage Artifacts</a>
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="pushed-to-live-sandbox-not-yet-available">Pushed to Live Sandbox, Not Yet Available</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If an offer with a release date set in the future is pushed from the Stage sandbox to the Live sandbox, the page for this offer is not yet available to users on the storefront. However, pages in this state can be indexed on the public internet. If you don’t want your page to be public information, wait to publish pages to the Live sandbox until immediately before your offer is scheduled to release.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="released-product-available-for-purchase">Released Product Available for Purchase</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If you set an offer's release date to match your product’s launch date (and do not enable early store discovery), the offer page only becomes discoverable to users once the product has been released. In this state, the offer page displays to users as available for purchase.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="create-an-faq-page">Create an FAQ Page</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages provide additional information about your product. While you can only create one FAQ page per product, the page can contain multiple questions and answers.</p>
			<p>Your product's FAQ page presents an opportunity to communicate key details to your users, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Responses to commonly asked user questions and concerns</li>
				<li>Ongoing promotions</li>
				<li>Details about Closed Access phases</li>
				<li>Opportunities to provide feedback about your product</li>
				<li>The state of your product and what users can expect in terms of future growth</li>
				<li>Information about core features that require additional steps, such as online play or in-app purchases</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While optional in most scenarios, creating an FAQ page is required for some products. To learn more, review the
				<a href="#faq-requirements">FAQ requirements</a>
				below.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="configure-your-faq">Configure Your FAQ</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To create an FAQ page for your product, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Pages</strong>.</li>
				<li>To the top right, click
					<strong>Create Page</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the Create Page screen, select
					<strong>FAQ page</strong>. Then, click
					<strong>Create</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the Add Questions screen, click
					<strong>Add Question</strong>. In the space provided, enter the desired question and answer text.</li>
				<li>Repeat step 4 as needed to add additional FAQs to your page.</li>
				<li>(Optional) After adding multiple FAQs, you can reorganize the list by clicking the
					<strong>grip icon</strong>
					to the top left of each question block and dragging it to the desired location. Alternatively, use the
					<strong>arrow icons</strong>
					to move individual question blocks up or down the list.</li>
				<li>Review your FAQ text and list order. When ready, click
					<strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="faq-requirements">FAQ Requirements</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In some scenarios, creating an FAQ page for your product is required. For example, FAQ pages are required for products being launched as Early Access titles or products that include blockchain technology or in-app purchases. This requirement boosts transparency and helps set users’ expectations for your product.</p>
			<p>To learn more about specific FAQ requirements, review the following resources:</p>
