			</div>
			<p>In 2018, Epic Games set out to create two things: a store with a direct player relationship and better economics for all developers via an 88/12 revenue share. Just a few years later, the Epic Games Store now reaches a global audience of more than 230M total players and 68M monthly active players - and it continues to grow!</p>
			<p>Most recently, we launched the Epic Games Store publishing tools to offer developers a streamlined, self-service process for distributing products on our storefront. These tools provide you with everything you need to manage your presence on the Epic Games Store so that you can take control of your product’s lifecycle:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up your product page to spread early awareness of your product prior to release.</li>
				<li>Highlight your product and attract users by adding custom text, videos, images, FAQs, and other content.</li>
				<li>Create offers and upload builds for your base product, editions, add-ons, DLC, and more.</li>
				<li>Localize your store presence to better reach global users through tailored content.</li>
				<li>Configure optional services like Epic Games Store achievements and cloud saves.</li>
				<li>Manage your product’s journey through the publishing workflow - from initial configuration to launch.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Epic Games is committed to building out our toolset to fit the needs of our developer partners. We regularly ship new features and updates to existing functionality that benefit our partners and promote a quality store experience for our users.</p>
			<p>At this time, the Epic Games Store publishing tools do not yet support the following types of products:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-game products</li>
				<li>Games with their own launchers</li>
				<li>Games that download or update builds outside of the Epic Games Store</li>
				<li>Games requiring multiple processes to be launched from the Epic Games Launcher</li>
				<li>VR-only games</li>
				<li>Games with editions or add-ons that have more mature ratings than the base game</li>
				<li>Games that are not localized in English</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, certain types of product configurations are not currently supported as we continue to build out the Epic Games Store publishing tools. For specifics, review our
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/whats-new/known-issues#feature-support">Feature Support</a>
				list.</p>
			<div>
				Pre-purchase offers are not currently supported by our self-service publishing tools. However, they have been configured by our Service Delivery team for a very limited number of products. If you have any questions or concerns about this limitation, contact us before you set up your product with the self-service tools by
				<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/">creating a private discussion</a>
				on our Developer Support site.
