			<p>Epic Online Services (EOS) are free, games-platform agnostic, services to launch, operate, and scale your game, whatever games platform your game clients run on, and whatever game engine you use for development, or if you use no game engine at all.</p>
			<p>They are split into two subsets: EOS Game Services and EOS Epic Account Services.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>EOS Game Services</strong>
					enable you to build and integrate online functionality into your game. You can set up your game to use Games Services without any requirement for your players to have an Epic Games account.
					<br>
					
					<!-- -->(See the
					<a href="/docs/en-US#eos-game-services">EOS Game Services</a>
					section below for more information.)</li>
				<li>
					<strong>EOS Epic Account Services</strong>
					provide player accounts. Use Epic Account Services to tap into an ecosystem of over 500 million players across multiple platforms and stores.
					<br>
					
					<!-- -->(See the
					<a href="/docs/en-US#eos-epic-account-services">EOS Epic Account Services</a>
					section below for more information.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>EOS also provides services for the Epic Games Store (documentation:
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/services">Epic Games Store Services</a>).</p>
			<p>To use any EOS services in your game, you integrate interfaces using the EOS tools. There is an interface for each service.</p>
			<p>EOS has several tools, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Developer Portal
					<br>
					
					<!-- -->(Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/dev-portal">Developer Portal</a>)</li>
				<li>The EOS SDK and API - in C and C#
					<br>
					
					<!-- -->(Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/services-overview">EOS SDK Key Information</a>
					and
					<a href="/docs/api-ref">EOS SDK API Reference</a>)</li>
				<li>The EOS Web API - HTTP APIs for common use cases
					<br>
					
					<!-- -->(Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/web-api-ref/web-api-introduction">EOS Web API Introduction</a>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For your game to use EOS Game Services, your players do not require an Epic Games account and your game does not have to use EOS Epic Account Services.</li>
				<li>Players can connect to your game using either an identity from a supported identity provider (such as a Steam account) or an Epic Games account. (See the section below on
					<a href="/docs/en-US#connection-type-and-player-accounts">Connection Type and Player Accounts</a>
					for information on which EOS interfaces to use.)</li>
