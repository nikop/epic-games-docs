			<p>Brand review enables your game (or software application) to integrate with EOS Epic Account Services. The brand review process verifies your game’s brand with Epic Games. Your brand is the company or real-world organization that is associated with your product.</p>
			<p>Before starting the brand review process, see the documentation
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review/brand-review-intro">Brand Review Introduction</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note on the terms “product” and “application”</strong>
				<br>
				In the Developer Portal during the brand review process, note the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“product” represents your game or software application. (For example, the game “Fall Guys”.)</li>
				<li>“application” represents an implementation of your product for Epic Account Services. An application associated with your product has settings for brand, user permissions (consent), and linked clients. (For example, the settings for Fall Guys' brand, user permissions and linked clients in Epic Account Services is an application.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This set of brand review pages uses “product” to mean game or software application and "application" to mean a product's Epic Account Services settings.</p>
