			</div>
			<p>Epic Games Store users can opt in to receive email notifications regarding a 
				<!-- -->product
				<!-- --> at time of purchase. In order to obtain the list of opted-in recipients, you must follow the following steps.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Your 
				<!-- -->organization
				<!-- --> owner must accept the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/organization-management/agreements">email sharing agreement</a>. Your organization must have a valid privacy policy on file. If you do not have a privacy policy, email addresses will not be collected.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Note - If you did not add a privacy policy at the time of creating your organization, you can request it to be added by contacting Service Delivery:
					<a href="/docs/en-UShttps://epicsupport.force.com/epicgamesstoreknowledgebase/s/my-cases">Create a case</a>.</p>

			<div>
				<h2 id="request-an-email-sharing-opt-in-list">Request an email sharing opt-in list</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can request your email sharing opt-in list by contacting Service Delivery:
				<a href="/docs/en-UShttps://epicsupport.force.com/epicgamesstoreknowledgebase/s/my-cases">Create a case</a>. In the case creation form, select
				<strong>Type</strong>
				as
				<em>Product</em>
				and
				<strong>Issue</strong>
				as
				<em>Email opt-in delivery request</em>.</p>
			<p>Requests typically take up to three days to fulfill, and are delivered to the requestor via encrypted email.</p>
			<p>You will receive a full history of opt-ins for the lifetime of your product since collection began. You must track opt-out requests independently from this list, as Epic Games Store will provide a history of all Epic Games Store users who have ever opted in to receive updates about your product since collection began.</p>
