				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create and manage discounts for your
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-offers">product offers</a>.</p>
			<p>Discounts apply strikethrough pricing to selected offers on the storefront. Strikethrough pricing displays the discounted price alongside the regular price to highlight the comparison to users.</p>
			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, discounts are defined by two primary elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the discount is available on the storefront, as determined by its start and end dates/time.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Discount rate</strong>: The percentage decrease applied to an offer's base price (e.g., 25% off).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can create two types of discounts for your product offers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Custom discount</strong>: A discount with customized start and end dates provided by your organization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Preset campaign</strong>: A discount associated with an Epic Games Store sale or event that includes preset start and end dates (e.g., the Epic Games MEGA Sale).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For both types of discounts, you can specify the percentage decrease as appropriate for your offers. However, some Epic-led preset campaigns require the discount value to be within a specific range.</p>
			<div>Discounts cannot be created for demos or any offers with a base price of $0.</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-guidelines">Discount Guidelines</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store maintains a number of guidelines for discounts on the storefront. During creation, discounts undergo validation to verify that these policies have been followed.</p>
			<p>Review the guidelines below to ensure the successful creation of custom and preset campaign discounts. These pricing guidelines apply on a per product basis for both Custom Sales and Epic Games Preset Campaigns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Only one discount can be applied to a product offer during a specific timeframe (i.e., multiple discounts cannot be active for a single offer at the same time).</li>
				<li>The discount start date must occur more than 24 hours after the time of creation.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be a value between 5<i>%</i>
					and 95<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>For post-launch discounts, the duration cannot exceed 30 consecutive days. For introductory offers, the duration cannot exceed 7 consecutive days.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: An introductory offer is a discount applied to your product offer at the time of its release. To learn more, review the
							<a href="#create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</a>
							section.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A product offer cannot be discounted for more than 45 days total during any 90-day window.</li>
				<li>A minimum 30-day cooldown period is required between discounts applied to a specific product offer.</li>
				<li>Discounts cannot be scheduled within 30 days of a product’s launch date or the end of an introductory offer.</li>
				<li>Discounts cannot be scheduled within 30 days of a price change (i.e., discounts must be scheduled at least 31 days after a price change).</li>
				<li>These pricing guidelines apply to both Custom Sales and Epic Games Preset Campaigns.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="creating-discounts">Creating Discounts</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 id="create-custom-or-preset-campaign-discount">Create Custom or Preset Campaign Discount</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create both custom and preset campaign discounts for your product offers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom discounts allow you to create your own discount campaigns with customized start and end dates. These dates determine when a discount is active on the storefront.</li>
				<li>Preset campaigns are associated with an Epic Games Store sale or event (e.g., the Epic Games MEGA Sale) and include preset start and end dates. These dates cannot be modified.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To be elligible for a discount, a product offer must be in the Live sandbox and have a specific launch date assigned. Discounts cannot be created for offers with an estimated or unknown launch date.</p>
			<div>
				Discounts applied to product offers at the time of their release must meet specific criteria. To learn more, review
				<a href="#create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</a>.</div>
			<p>To create a custom or preset campaign discount, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Promo Campaigns &gt; Discounts</strong>.</li>
				<li>To the top right, click
					<strong>Create Discount</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Select Discount Type menu, choose one of the Epic-led preset campaigns.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: The options are for upcoming campaigns only.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the Discount Info section, provide the appropriate details for your discount. Ensure the information adheres to our
					<a href="#discount-guidelines">discount guidelines</a>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Custom discounts</strong>: Provide the name, start date/time, end date/time, and discount rate.
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Tip</strong>: To easily identify discounts, we recommend using a naming convention that clearly conveys the timeframe and content of the campaign, such as
									<em>[Publisher Sale] Epic Games - Spring ‘23</em>
									or
									<em>[Franchise Sale] Rocket League - Summer ‘23</em>.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Preset campaigns</strong>: Provide the discount rate. All other details are provided by Epic Games and cannot be modified.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the Offers section, select each offer to include in the discount.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>: The Offers section only contains offers in the Live sandbox, excluding any Demo-type offers or those with a base price of $0.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Review the details of your discount to ensure accuracy. Then, click
					<strong>Validate</strong>.
					<ul>
						<li>If your discount successfully passes validation, continue to step 7.</li>
						<li>If the discount does not adhere to our
							<a href="#discount-guidelines">discount guidelines</a>, a validation error displays at the top of the screen. In the Offers section, error details are provided for each affected offer. Update your discount as needed to resolve the issues, then click
							<strong>Validate</strong>
							again. Once your discount passes validation, continue to step 7.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Save and Submit</strong>
					to create your discount.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the discount is created, it displays in the table on the Discounts page with the
				<em>Published</em>
				status. On its start date, the discount becomes live on the storefront, and its status is updated to
				<em>Active</em>.</p>
			<p>Prior to a discount’s start date, you can edit or delete the discount as needed. To learn more, review
				<a href="#managing-discounts">Managing Discounts</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</h3>
			</div>
			<p>An introductory offer refers to a discount applied to a product offer at the time of its release, such as a launch day sale. The product offer must revert to full price no later than 7 days after release.</p>
			<p>The discount created for an introductory offer must meet the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The start date and time of the discount must exactly match the product offer’s launch date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount rate must be between 5<i>%</i>
					and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>The duration cannot exceed 7 days past the launch date.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To create an introductory offer, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/store-presence/manage-offers">Offers</a>
					section of the Dev Portal, create a new offer (or update an existing offer) and set its Launch Date to a time in the future. Take note of this date and time as you will need this exact information when creating your discount in step 3.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/release-management">Release Management</a>
					section and promote your offer to the Live sandbox. This step must be completed prior to creating your discount. The offer will
					<strong>not</strong>
					be visible to users on the storefront until its Early Store Discovery or Launch Date occurs.</li>
				<li>Navigate to the Discounts section and create a new
					<a href="#create-custom-or-preset-campaign-discount">custom discount</a>:
					<ul>
						<li>Set the Start Date and Time to the exact launch date and time of your offer.</li>
						<li>Set the End Date and Time to no later than 7 days after its start date and time.</li>
						<li>Set the Discount Rate to a value between 5<i>%</i>
							and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
						<li>In the Offers section, select your product offer from step 1.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>After providing the required information for your introductory offer, click
					<strong>Validate</strong>. Then, click
					<strong>Submit</strong>
					to finalize your discount.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: If any validation errors occur, you must resolve those issues before you can submit the discount. To learn more, review our
							<a href="#discount-guidelines">discount guidelines</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
