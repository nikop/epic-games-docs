			</div>
			<p>On the Social Overlay, a player with an Epic Games account can invite another player with an Epic Games account, who is playing the same game, to join a party. The players in a party can do most of the activities they can do in an EOS SDK lobby or session, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>RTC functions: voice communications.</li>
				<li>Invite a player.</li>
				<li>Mute a player.</li>
				<li>Kick a player.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The reason players may want to join a party is so that they can use voice communications to discuss a game before they start playing. For example, they might agree on which in-game customization each player is going to use.</p>
			<p>For more information on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to create a lobby, see
					<a href="/docs/game-services/lobbies">Lobby Interface</a>.</li>
				<li>How to create a session, see
					<a href="/docs/game-services/sessions">Session Interface</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="register-callback">Register Callback</h2>
			</div>
			<p>When you initialize the EOS SDK, you need to register callback
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested
				</code>if you want to use a lobby, or<code>EOS_Sessions_AddNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>
				for a session, after you successfully call
				<code>EOS_Platform_Create</code>. This is so that the EOS service can notify you when players use the Social Overlay to leave a party.</p>
			<p>For more information on how to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Initialize the EOS SDK, see the
					<a href="/docs/game-services/eos-platform-interface">Platform Interface</a>
					documentation.</li>
				<li>Use
					<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested</code>
					if you want to use a lobby, or<code>EOS_Sessions_AddNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>for a session, see
					<a href="#allow-players-to-join-a-party">Allow Players to Leave Your Party</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="allow-players-to-join-a-party">Allow Players to Join a Party</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A player with an Epic Games account can invite another player with an Epic Games account,  who is playing the same game, to join a party. If the invited player accepts the invitation, every player in the party sees the new player on the Social Overlay on the Friends list under the Your Party heading.</p>
			<p>To do this, players need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Invite Another Player to a Party</strong>
					</p>
					<p>On the Social Overlay, a player with an Epic Games account goes to the profile of another player with an Epic Games account playing the same game and selects
						<strong>INVITE</strong>.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong>
						the EOS SDK automatically adds a player to a lobby by themselves when they first sign in to your game.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Select the Invitation to a Party</strong>
					</p>
					<p>The invited player receives a notification that a player invited them to play your game. They either select the invitation or go to their Friends list and select the invitation (they can see it in the Invitations to Play heading), or go directly to the profile of the player that invited them.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Accept or Ignore the Invitation</strong>
					</p>
					<p>On the Social Overlay, the invited player can accept or ignore the invitation. To do this they select
						<strong>ACCEPT INVITE</strong>
						or
						<strong>IGNORE</strong>
						invite.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="allow-players-to-leave-a-party">Allow Players to Leave a Party</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A player with an Epic Games account can leave a party on the Social Overlay. To do this they go to their Friends list and select
				<strong>LEAVE PARTY</strong>.</p>
			<p>When a player leaves a party, the Social Overlay calls
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested</code>
				if you use a lobby, or<code>EOS_Sessions_AddNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>for a session, and sends a notification to you.
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested
				</code>includes a handle to the lobby and
				<code>EOS_Sessions_AddNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>
				includes the name of the session associated with the leave request. You need to do any necessary cleanup in your game and then call
				<code>EOS_Lobby_LeaveLobby</code>
				with the handle of the lobby so that you identify the correct lobby or session for the player to leave.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="show-players-across-multiple-platforms-in-a-party">Show Players Across Multiple Platforms in a Party</h2>
			</div>
			<p>On the Social Overlay, a player sees the list of other players in their party under the heading Your Party. They see the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Platform friends</strong>
					</p>
					<p>These are Epic friends that are playing your game on the same platform.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Friends not on the same platform</strong>
					</p>
					<p>These are Epic friends that are playing your game but are not on the same platform.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Players that are not friends</strong>
					</p>
					<p>These are players that are playing your game but are not Epic friends. These players are not listed separately, the player only sees a number that represents how many players are not friends. For example, +2.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Friends that they blocked</strong>
					</p>
					<p>These are friends that they block using the Social Overlay. The player sees the blocked player and the label “Blocked”.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="remove-callbacks">Remove Callbacks</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When you shut down your game, you need to remove the callback you registered earlier that handles notifications for players with Epic Games accounts who leave a party:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>EOS_Sessions_AddNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To do this call the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<code>EOS_Lobby_RemoveNotifyLeaveLobbyRequested</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>EOS_Sessions_RemoveNotifyLeaveSessionRequested</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
