			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can upload multiple images for each product offer you create. General offer images are used to represent your product offers throughout the storefront. Library offer images are displayed to users who purchase your product within the Library section of their Epic Games launcher.</p>
			<p>To upload offer images in the Dev Portal, navigate to
				<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Offers &gt; Your Offer &gt; Images</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="offer-images---general">Offer Images - General</h4>
			</div>
			<p>General offer images represent your product's main promotional key art and display in multiple locations on the storefront. For best results, center your key art and logo within the critical area of the image. Your key art
				<strong>must</strong>
				include your product logo. For a full list of branding resources and policies, review the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/get-started/brand-guidelines-overview">Brand Guidelines Overview</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines">Content Guidelines</a>.</p>
			<p>You can upload both landscape and portrait images for your offers. Landscape images display on your product pages in areas such as the Editions or Add-On sections. Portrait images display in areas such as the checkout flow or wishlist notifications.</p>

					<p>An example Carousel placement</p>
				</div>
			</center>
			<p>Displayed at the top of your Product Home page, the Carousel features the primary media that users can engage with when visiting your store presence. Carousel media can include a variety of both image and video assets for users to scroll through while reviewing your product.</p>
			<p>For an optimal user experience, we recommend uploading a minimum of five assets to the Carousel, including at least one video.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we recommend the following as best practice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Update your assets periodically, especially when releasing new product updates.</li>
				<li>Minimize the use of text on your assets to best reach users across all regions.</li>
				<li>Prioritize assets highlighting beta, early access, or other special offers and events when ordering your media (i.e., display these assets first in the Carousel).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To add media to the Carousel in the Dev Portal, navigate to
				<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Pages &gt; Product Home &gt; Carousel</strong>. After uploading your assets, drag each item in the list (or use the up and down arrows) to establish the order in which media displays to users.</p>
			<p>Media can also be added to a carousel displayed on dedicated offer pages by navigating to
				<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Pages &gt; [Offer Name] &gt; Carousel</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<p>If you do not have video assets or screenshots available, you can upload key art without a logo in this section. However, statistics show that this negatively impacts a product's rate of purchase. As best practice, uploading videos or product screenshots is recommended.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="videos">Videos</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Uploading at least one video is highly recommended as users often prefer video content when making purchasing decisions. For best results, videos should not start on a black screen or include ratings.</p>
			<p>To best capture users' attention, display video assets first in the Carousel, then follow with screenshots.</p>

			<p>The Additional Images option allows you to upload extra gameplay screenshots or marketing assets to further show off your product. While adding additional images is optional, uploading 1-6 assets is recommended.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: By default, this content is collapsed for users who visit your page. To ensure users are immediately presented with your best product images, upload those assets to the
				<a href="#carousel">Carousel</a>
				featured on your Product Home page.</p>
