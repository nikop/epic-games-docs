				<h2 id="pricing-your-product">Pricing Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>This page describes the Epic Game Store's restrictions and best practices around pricing. It also includes how to work with your Release Manager to set up your regional prices. Pricing is one of the most important decisions to make as you set up your product. Consider the following factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your production costs</li>
				<li>Your target audience</li>
				<li>Perceived value of the product</li>
				<li>Gameplay duration and replayability</li>
				<li>Similar products on the market today</li>
				<li>Upcoming discounts and sales you may offer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, consider regularly evaluating and adjusting prices based on user feedback and changes in the market. Your pricing strategy helps you build a sustainable business while delivering value to your audience.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="pricing-restrictions">Pricing Restrictions</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store is committed to facilitating fair and competitive pricing for your products. However, ultimately the prices you set are up to you. Note that some regions have laws in place to protect users against price gouging and price manipulation. To maintain this commitment, rules apply to all prices.</p>

				<h2 id="manage-your-price-tiers">Manage your price tiers</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can suggest pricing for your offers with the
				<em>Epic Games Store - Regional Price Tiers</em>
				form. Your Release Manager can provide you with this form. It contains details of all Epic Games Store pricing regions and their associated currencies.</p>
			<p>To complete the form:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select
					<strong>Base Price Tier</strong>
					for USA / ROW to populate default regional equivalents across all regions.</li>
				<li>Manually enter the
					<strong>Suggested Retail Price</strong>
					(SRP) for any regions that do not have the desired suggested price in the SRP column. The
					<strong>Delta</strong>
					column shows the % difference between our suggested prices and what's entered under SRP.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: If you submit suggested pricing for multiple offers, you can copy Columns D/E in the sheet. You do not need to submit multiple forms.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In the Developer Portal (Dev Portal), you can create and manage discounts for your offers.</p>
			<p>When you apply a discount to an offer, the storefront displays strikethrough pricing. This means that the store displays the discounted price alongside the regular price to highlight the comparison to users.</p>
			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, discounts are defined by two primary elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Duration</strong>: The length of time the discount is available on the storefront, as determined by its start and end dates/times.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Discount value</strong>: The percentage decrease applied to the offer's base price, such as 25% off.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the Dev Portal, you can create two types of discount for your offers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Custom discount</strong>: A discount with a customized campaign name and start and end dates provided by your organization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Preset campaign</strong>: A discount that is associated with an Epic Games Store sale or an event that includes preset start and end dates (for example, the Epic Games MEGA Sale).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For both types of discount, you can specify the percentage decrease. However, some Epic-led preset campaigns require the discount value to be in a specific range.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="access-requirements">Access Requirements</h2>
			</div>
			<p>In order to let users in your organization create and manage discounts, you must grant them the appropriate permissions. Admin users are granted these permissions by default.</p>
			<p>To grant the necessary permissions, you can either create a new custom role or update one of your existing custom roles. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, click
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					from the main menu and select the
					<strong>Role</strong>
					tab.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Create a new role</strong>: Click
							<strong>New Role</strong>
							on the top right. Then, enter the appropriate name and description.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Update an existing role</strong>: Locate the appropriate custom role in the list. (Custom roles display a
							<em>Custom</em>
							tag beneath their name.) Then, click the
							<strong>options menu</strong>
							(it looks like three dots (
							<strong>...</strong>
							)) and select
							<strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the Role Control section, expand the Store category and select
					<strong>Discounting</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click
					<strong>Save</strong>.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Tip</strong>
							: If you are creating a new role, ensure you also select any other permissions you need to assign to this role.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Lastly, access the
					<strong>Members</strong>
					tab and complete one of the following actions:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Assign new role</strong>: Locate the appropriate user from the list. Then, click the
							<strong>options menu</strong>
							(it looks like three dots (...)) and choose
							<strong>Change Access Rights.</strong>
							On the popup, select your new role and click
							<strong>Change</strong>.
							<strong>Tip</strong>: If needed, you can add new users by clicking
							<strong>Invite</strong>
							at the top right and following the prompts.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Review existing role</strong>: Locate the user(s) in the list requiring discount access. In the Role column, ensure your updated custom role is listed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-guidelines">Discount Guidelines</h2>
			</div>
			<p>There are guidelines for discounts on the Epic Games Store. When you create a discount, it automatically undergoes validation. This ensures that your discount follows the guidelines before it appears on the storefront.</p>
			<p>The following discount guidelines apply on a per-product basis for both custom discounts and Epic Games preset campaigns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can apply only one discount to a product offer in a specific timeframe. In other words, multiple discounts cannot be active for a single offer at the same time.</li>
				<li>You must submit the discount at least 24 hours before the discount start date and time.</li>
				<li>The discount value must be between 5<i>%</i>
					and 95<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>For post-launch discounts, the duration cannot exceed 30 consecutive days. For introductory offers, the following guidelines apply:
					<ul>
						<li>The duration cannot exceed seven consecutive days.</li>
						<li>The discount amount must be a maximum of 40%.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: An introductory offer is a discount applied to your product offer at the time of its release. To learn more, see
							<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/epic-managed/pricing-epic-managed#create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</a>
							on this page.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You cannot discount a product offer cannot for more than 45 days total during any 90-day window.</li>
				<li>You must allow a minimum 30-day cooldown period between discounts that you apply to a specific product offer.</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule discounts within the following time windows:
					<ul>
						<li>Within 30 days of a product's launch date.</li>
						<li>Within 30 days of the end of an introductory offer.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Products in a pre-purchase state can have discounts, but the discounts start together with pre-purchase and end when the product launches. You can convert the discount to an introductory offer after the product launches. However, the following guidelines apply:
					<ul>
						<li>The discount must be the same discount value as the introductory offer.</li>
						<li>You must configure the discount at the same time as you configure the pre-purchase discount.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You cannot schedule a discount for a date within 30 days of a price change. In other words, you must schedule discounts for a date at least 31 days after a price change.</li>

				<h3 id="create-introductory-offer">Create Introductory Offer</h3>
			</div>
			<p>An introductory offer is a discount applied to a product offer at the time of the product's release, such as a launch day sale. The product offer must revert to full price no later than seven days after release.</p>

				<li>The discount value must be between 5<i>%</i>
					and 40<i>%</i>.</li>
				<li>The duration cannot be more than seven days.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The product offer receiving the discount must have a specific release date assigned that matches its effective date (for example, the date the product offer becomes purchasable on the storefront).

			<p>To create an introductory offer,  follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
