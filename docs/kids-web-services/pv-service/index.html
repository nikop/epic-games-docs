				<span>
					<span aria-label="tooltip Parent Verification" tabindex="0" role="button">Parent Verification</span>
				</span>
				(PV) service is a free service that enables you to verify the identity of the person designated as the parent of a child using your app.</p>
			<p>Hereâ€™s a summary of how it works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Within your product's interface, you collect the parent's email address and pass it to KWS via a single authenticated API call.</li>
				<li>This call triggers the verification flow, which is entirely managed by KWS.</li>
				<li>Within this flow, the parent verifies their identity using one of
					<a href="/docs/kids-web-services/pv-service/verification-methods">a selection of verification methods</a>
					such as scanning an ID or providing payment card details.</li>
				<li>KWS notifies you of the successful verification using a webhook or a 'verification response', or both.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For full details of the PV service verification flow, see the
				<a href="/docs/kids-web-services/pv-service/use-cases">example use case</a>.</p>
