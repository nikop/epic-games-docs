			<p>Learn more about the requirements and processes for getting a game rating for
				<strong>non-mature</strong>
				and
				<strong>mature</strong>
				titles in Korea.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The Korea GRAC and Juvenile Protection Act strongly regulates game content to present legitimate rating marks. Game ratings in Korea are
						<strong>mandatory by law</strong>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The GRAC rating is
						<strong>required for all playable builds</strong>
						available to the public, including demo, beta, and test builds. However, the GRAC rating is not required during a pre-purchase period, because there is no build.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Please be aware that the distinction between non-mature titles and mature titles follows the
						<a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/english/enforcement/ageratingsymbol.aspx">Game Industry Promotion Act (GRAC) guidelines</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The steps to get a GRAC rating are different for
						<strong>non-mature titles</strong>
						and
						<strong>mature titles</strong>, as noted below.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="non-mature-titles-age-15-and-below">Non-mature Titles (age 15 and below)</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Epic Games</strong>
				has acquired a permit to self-rate non-mature titles to be released on the Epic Games Store. This permit helps make the self-rating process faster for non-mature titles—and it is free for our partners.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Register</strong>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Classify</strong>
						— When the rating is classified in the GRAC system, the Epic Games Korea team emails the rating to the developer/publisher.</p>

			<div>
				<h4 id="timing">Timing</h4>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Submit your Independent Rating Classification Survey for non-mature titles at least
						<strong>five business days</strong>
						in advance of your target launch date.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Once your rating is classified in the GRAC system, the Epic Games Korea team will email the rating to the developer/publisher, typically within three business days.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>

						<strong>Your mature title must have a rating to launch.</strong>
						The Epic Games Korea team recommends you submit your application to the GRAC system
						<strong>at least six weeks</strong>
						in advance of your target launch date to account for delays from GRAC.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The rating is typically provided about four weeks after submission; however, this timing may vary and could exceed four weeks. The Epic Games Korea team recommends you periodically visit the GRAC website to check on the status of your submission.</p>
