			<p>The Epic Games Store team is aware of the following issues impacting the publishing tools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Push to Stage</strong>: Promotion to the Stage sandbox may take several minutes after making even small changes. If the submission is still processing after 10 minutes,
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/">create a private discussion</a>
					on our Developer Support site for assistance.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Not Sellable/Bundle Only option</strong>: While enabling this option for an offer prevents users from directly purchasing it, the offer remains visible in the storefront. Any user who attempts to purchase the offer experiences an error during checkout and cannot complete the purchase.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Localization template</strong>: Before uploading localization content, you currently must remove any columns for languages you have not translated. Inclusion of empty columns results in an error when uploading the template.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Display Name field</strong>: The name entered when creating a product is only used within the Developer Portal. A future update will make the label of this field more specific.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Agreements</strong>: You cannot use a screen magnifier or operating system dictation feature to assist you when you view an agreement.</li>
			</ul>
