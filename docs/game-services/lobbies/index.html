			<p>Lobbies provide a persistent connection between users for the purpose of sharing game and user state with real-time updates. Typically, users can create or join lobbies to form teams, select pre-game options, and wait for additional players to join in before playing together. Using the
				<strong>Lobby Interface</strong>, your users can create, join, leave, and manage lobbies.</p>
			<p>To access the Lobby Interface, acquire an
				<code>EOS_HLobby</code>
				handle through the Platform Interface function,
				<code>EOS_Platform_GetLobbyInterface</code>. All Lobby Interface functions require this handle as their first parameter. You must ensure that the
				<code>EOS_HPlatform</code>
				handle is ticking for appropriate callbacks to trigger when operations complete.</p>
			<div>

			<p>The
				<code>EOS_Lobby_CreateLobby</code>
				function creates a lobby. For more properties and full details see
				<a href="/docs/api-ref/structs/eos-lobby-create-lobby-options">EOS_Lobby_CreateLobbyOptions</a>. Initialize
				<code>EOS_Lobby_CreateLobbyOptions</code>

				<code>EOS_LMS_CLOSED</code>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="lobby-lifecycle">Lobby Lifecycle</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The lifecycle of a lobby generally follows this sequence:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A user creates the lobby. This user automatically joins the lobby and becomes both the first member and the owner.</li>
				<li>The owner sets up the lobby's initial state, and may invite users to join.</li>
				<li>Other users join and leave the lobby. While connected, members update state information about themselves and can invite other users.</li>
				<li>The lobby owner can update data specific to the state of the game.</li>
				<li>The owner can remove members from the lobby or transfer ownership status to another member.</li>
				<li>Users can play multiple rounds of the game without leaving or destroying the lobby. Your game's logic determines the lifetime of a lobby.</li>
				<li>Finally, the owner destroys the lobby.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="joining-or-leaving-a-lobby">Joining or Leaving a Lobby</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Calling
				<code>EOS_Lobby_JoinLobby</code>
				with a valid
				<code>EOS_HLobbyDetails</code>
				handle causes the user to attempt to join the lobby that the handle references. A user can be in multiple lobbies at the same time; joining one lobby does not require the user to leave another. Joining a new lobby does not leave any existing lobbies. Leaving or destroying a lobby must be explicit.</p>
			<p>To leave a lobby, call
				<code>EOS_Lobby_LeaveLobby</code>. If the departing user is the current lobby owner, EOS will select a new owner from the remaining users. All members will receive notification when any user leaves, as well as when ownership changes.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="inviting-users-to-a-lobby">Inviting Users to a Lobby</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Users who are in a lobby can invite others to join them with the
				<code>EOS_Lobby_SendInvite</code>
				function. The
				<code>EOS_Lobby_OnSendInviteCallback</code>
				triggers locally once the invitation is successfully sent. The target user receives a
				<a href="/docs/game-services/lobbies#notifications">notification</a>
				when the invitation arrives. The game then uses
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLobbyInviteAccepted</code>
				to know when the player clicks
				<strong>Accept</strong>
				in the overlay. For more information about the interaction between the
				<strong>Invite</strong>
				button, the social overlay, and lobbies, see
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/social-overlay-overview/sdk-integration">Social Overlay Integration: Using Lobbies</a>. For invite functionality with the Epic Games Launcher, be sure to map your deployments to your

			<div>
				<h3 id="updating-all-invitations">Updating All Invitations</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To ensure that your local cache contains all pending invitations, call

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>When the operation finishes, your
				<code>EOS_Lobby_OnQueryInvitesCallback</code>
				runs with an
				<code>EOS_Lobby_QueryInvitesCallbackInfo</code>
				data structure. On success, the local cache contains all pending invitations for the specified user that you can search. This is useful at startup to discover any invitations that were sent while the user was offline. During play, users with a registered notification should rarely need to call this function.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="retrieving-an-invitation-from-the-cache">Retrieving an Invitation from the Cache</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To examine a cached invitation, first call
				<code>EOS_Lobby_GetInviteCount</code>

				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>This function runs against your local cache, and will immediately return a
				<code>uint32_t</code>
				indicating the number of pending invitations in the cache. You can then call
				<code>EOS_Lobby_GetInviteIdByIndex</code>
				with an

			<p>
				<code>EOS_Lobby_GetInviteIdByIndex</code>
				also runs against the local cache and will immediately return
				<code>EOS_Success</code>
				if the call succeeds. On success, the output parameters that you provided will contain a copy of the invitation data and its size. You are responsible for freeing the buffer when you no longer need it.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Users receive invitations in real time as long as they have registered a callback through
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyLobbyInviteReceived</code>. The callback data includes all of the relevant information about the invitation. At this point, users can use
				<code>EOS_Lobby_CopyLobbyDetailsHandleByInviteId</code>
				to retrieve the invitation in the form of an
				<code>EOS_HLobbyDetails</code>, which the user must have to join the lobby. When shutting down the application or going offline, use
				<code>EOS_Lobby_RemoveNotifyLobbyInviteReceived</code>
				to remove your callback from the notification list.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="removing-a-member-from-a-lobby">Removing a Member from a Lobby</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The lobby owner may remove a lobby member at any time. To do this, call

			<div>
				<h2 id="searching-for-a-lobby">Searching for a Lobby</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				<code>EOS_Lobby_CreateLobbySearch</code>
				creates a handle (type
				<code>EOS_HLobbySearch</code>) that you can use to search for lobbies that are set up to be discoverable (see "Permission Levels" for more information). Use the functions below to configure this handle, then call
				<code>EOS_LobbySearch_Find</code>
				to execute it. On successful completion, the application can navigate through the search results. Multiple search operations can run simultaneously with different handles.</p>
			<p>After a search completes, use
				<code>EOS_LobbySearch_GetSearchResultCount</code>
				to get the number of results for a given
				<code>EOS_HLobbySearch</code>
				handle. You can then request copies of individual results with
				<code>EOS_LobbySearch_CopySearchResultByIndex</code>. When you are finished with your copy of the data, dispose of it with
				<code>EOS_LobbyDetails_Release</code>
				to reclaim the memory it was using.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="searching-by-lobby-id">Searching By Lobby ID</h3>
			</div>
			<p>If a user has the exact lobby ID, they can search directly for it with

			<div>
				<h3 id="searching-by-user-id">Searching By User ID</h3>

			<div>
				<h3 id="searching-by-attributes">Searching By Attributes</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The most robust way to find lobbies is to search for a desired subset of settings. This could be in response to the user choosing a collection of filters in a user interface, it could be done automatically behind the scenes based on the user's skill and other factors, or it could be a combination of both methods.</p>
			<p>
				<code>EOS_LobbySearch_SetParameter</code>
				allows for the user to set up
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AttributeData</code>
				and provide an
				<code>EOS_EComparisonOp</code>
				that dictates how the attribute is compared against all existing lobbies stored with the service.  One or more of these calls will set the search parameters with an implicit boolean

			<div>
				<h2 id="event-notifications">Event Notifications</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Users have a persistent connection to the lobby and are notified of events that happen during a lobby's lifetime. Registering for a notification can be done at startup since enough information is provided with each callback to fully describe the lobby affected.</p>

				<h2 id="voice-communications">Voice Communications</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can host EOS Voice chat rooms on Epic servers using EOS Lobbies, or on your own backend servers. Users can communicate one-on-one or in groups across multiple platforms, during a match, or in your product’s lobby. See
				<a href="/docs/game-services/voice#voice-flow-with-lobbies">Voice with Lobbies</a>
				and
				<a href="/docs/game-services/voice">Voice Interface</a>
				for more information.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="maintaining-a-connection">Maintaining a Connection</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Applications that use the EOS Lobbies RTC rooms features do not need to manually join or leave voice rooms, this is automatically handled internally by the Lobby system.  If the lobby is successfully created with an RTC Room enabled, the lobby system will automatically join and maintain the connection to the RTC room as long as the local user remains in the lobby.</p>
			<p>Applications may use the optional
				<code>EOS_Lobby_IsRTCRoomConnected</code>,
				<code>EOS_Lobby_AddNotifyRTCRoomConnectionChanged</code>, and
				<code>EOS_Lobby_RemoveNotifyRTCRoomConnectionChanged</code>
				functions for informational purposes if desired. An appropriate example would be showing a disconnected icon when disconnected from Lobby RTC services while in a multiplayer lobby.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="interacting-with-rtc-functions">Interacting with RTC Functions</h3>
			</div>
			<p>To interact with the the
				<code>EOS_RTC_</code>* or
				<code>EOS_RTCAudio_</code>* suites of functions, applications must first use the
				<code>EOS_Lobby_GetRTCRoomName</code>
				function to get the room name associated with their lobby.  The earliest that
				<code>EOS_Lobby_GetRTCRoomName</code>
				can be called successfully is inside of the
				<code>EOS_Lobby_OnJoinLobbyCallback</code>
				or
				<code>EOS_Lobby_OnCreateLobbyCallback</code>, when the Result parameter is
				<code>EOS_Success</code>.  It is also at this time an application should register for all RTC notifications specific to the Lobby’s RTC room, to avoid missing any notifications, such as existing members of the room, that can happen very shortly after these notifications.</p>
			<p>Example uses of the RTC Room Name:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When registering for notifications, such as talking status, or room membership</li>
				<li>When muting or unmuting the local user's audio output for the room</li>
				<li>When blocking or unblocking room participants</li>
				<li>When setting local audio device settings.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="lobby-rtc-replacement-functions">Lobby RTC-Replacement Functions</h3>
			</div>
			<p>The following functions are used to replace
				<code>EOS_RTC_</code>* functions that would normally be used, but are incompatible Lobbies, either due to the feature being handled internally, the data no longer being application-provided, or the functionality being an
				<code>EOS_RTCAdmin_</code>* function.</p>

			<p>As a lobby owner you can hard-mute an existing lobby member by calling
				<code>EOS_Lobby_HardMuteMember</code>
				with an
				<code>EOS_Lobby_HardMuteMemberOptions</code>
				data structure. This structure holds information if the given member should be muted or not. Hard-muting changes the audibility of a lobby member for everyone, regardless of their local mute status.</p>

			<p>When the operation finishes, your
				<code>EOS_Lobby_OnHardMuteMemberCallback</code>
				runs with an
				<code>EOS_Lobby_HardMuteMemberCallbackInfo</code>
				data structure. If the data structure's
				<code>ResultCode</code>
				field indicates success, its
				<code>LobbyId</code>
				field contains the lobby's ID value and
				<code>TargetUserId</code>
				contains the member whose hard mute status has been updated.</p>

				<h2 id="usage-limitations">Usage Limitations</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Lobbies provide a persistent connection between your users, for the purpose of sharing game and user state with real-time updates. Typically, users can create or join lobbies to chat with other users, form teams, select pre-game options, and wait for additional users to join in before playing together. For general information about throttling, usage quotas, and best practices, see the service usage limitation section of the
				<a href="/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/working-with-the-eos-sdk/conventions-and-limitations#service-usage-limitations">EOS SDK - Conventions and Limitations</a>
				page.</p>
			<p>The following are general limitations for the lobby service:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Feature</th>
						<th>Service Limit</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Max players in a lobby</td>
						<td>64</td>
					</tr>

						<td>Max session attributes</td>
						<td>100</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Max member attributes</td>
						<td>100</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>String attribute length</td>
						<td>1000 characters</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Additionally, there are per-user rate limitations. Consider the following limitations to avoid throttling:</p>
