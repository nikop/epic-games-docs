			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, an artifact represents a group of binaries, metadata, and configurations used to fulfill user requests to download content. In the Dev Portal, the Artifacts and Binaries section allows you to review and upload binaries to your artifacts.</p>
			<p>When you first create your product, an artifact for that product is automatically generated. Artifacts are also auto-generated for any additional offers you create that feature downloadable content, such as Demo type offers.</p>
			<p>Note that artifacts are
				<strong>not</strong>
				automatically created for Add-On type offers as add-ons may or may not feature downloadable content. You can create artifacts for these offers as needed through the
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers#artifact-settings">Offers section</a>
				of the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Notes about Offer Dates</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Depending on how the release date is configured for an offer determines when uploading a binary to that offerâ€™s artifact is necessary.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Estimated or Unknown Release Date</strong>: If an offer is configured with an estimated or unknown release date, uploading a binary is not required to push your offer to the Stage or Live sandbox. Binaries are only required when preparing for launch with an exact release date.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Exact Release Date</strong>: If the offer has been assigned an exact release date, the associated artifact must have an attached binary before it can be pushed to the Stage sandbox.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To learn more, review the Dates section of
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/manage-offers#dates">Manage Offers</a>.</p>

			<p>The BuildPatch tool (BPT) is a command line tool that allows you to securely package and upload binary files for your product to the Dev sandbox. You must use this tool in order to upload binaries to your artifacts in the Dev Portal.</p>
			<p>To download the tool, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Artifacts and Binaries</strong>.</li>
				<li>To the top right, click
					<strong>Download Tool</strong>.</li>
				<li>Refer to the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/uploading-binaries/bpt-instructions-160">BuildPatch Tool Instructions</a>
					for more information.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="upload-the-binary">Upload the Binary</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Follow the steps below to attach binaries to your artifacts through the Manage Artifact screen. You can also review artifact details and active binaries from this screen.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Artifacts and Binaries</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select an artifact to edit by clicking its name or the corresponding
					<strong>menu (...) icon</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the Manage Artifact screen, click
					<strong>Upload Binary</strong>.</li>
				<li>Use the
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/uploading-binaries/bpt-instructions-160">BuildPatch Tool Instructions</a>
					to complete this process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you upload your binary, you can add the appropriate labels to your artifact in the Dev Portal. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Navigate to
					<strong>Your Product &gt; Epic Games Store &gt; Artifacts and Binaries</strong>. Then, select the appropriate artifact from the list.</li>
				<li>On the Manage Artifacts screen, click the
					<strong>menu (...) icon</strong>
					in the Active Binaries section. Then, select
					<strong>Manage Platforms</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the appropriate platform for your build. Then, click
					<strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once a platform has been selected, the binary automatically receives the
				<em>Live</em>
				label. These labels allow your binary to be accessible from the Epic Games Launcher.</p>
			<p>Applying a label to a binary associates a label name (e.g.,
				<em>Live</em>) and a platform (e.g.,
				<em>Win32</em>) with a single binary version. Multiple labels can be assigned to the same binary. The Epic Games Launcher only queries for binaries associated with the platform on which it is currently running. For example, the Win32 Launcher client only queries using a platform of Win32, preventing it from receiving binaries labeled with
				<em>Windows</em>
				or
				<em>Mac</em>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="select-deployment-id">Select Deployment ID</h3>
			</div>
			<p>If your product uses the Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK, then your build must specify the correct deployment when it initializes the EOS SDK. To make sure that your build can identify the correct deployment, you must set a deployment ID on your artifact. When the Epic Games Launcher starts your build, it sends this deployment ID to your build as a command-line parameter.</p>
			<p>The Epic Games Launcher sends the deployment ID in the command-line parameter
				<code>-epicdeploymentid</code>
				and the ID of the sandbox that contains this deployment in the parameter
				<code>-epicsandboxid</code>. If you do not specify a deployment ID, then the Epic Games Launcher does not send the parameter
				<code>-epicdeploymentid</code>
				to your product.</p>
			<p>The deployment ID is also stored in the environment configuration file for the artifact on the product user's machine. This file is stored in the
				<code>.egstore</code>
				subdirectory of the game installation directory. The filename has the form
				<code>&lt;artifactid&gt;appconfig.json</code>. Example:
				<code>915f171a87bf4a75b3456c968b5fde4cappconfig.json</code>.</p>

				<h4 id="set-a-deployment-id-on-an-artifact">Set a Deployment ID on an Artifact</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To set a deployment ID on an artifact:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Dev Portal, go to
					<strong>Your Product</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Epic Games Store</strong>
					&gt;
					<strong>Artifacts and Binaries</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the name of the artifact or the corresponding menu (<strong>...</strong>) icon.</li>
				<li>In
					<strong>Deployment ID</strong>, select the deployment you want to link to this artifact.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h4 id="notes-about-deployment-ids-on-artifacts">Notes about Deployment IDs on Artifacts</h4>
			</div>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deployment IDs are optional on artifacts.</li>
				<li>You can only select a deployment ID that refers to an active deployment.</li>
				<li>If you do not select a deployment ID on an artifact, then the Epic Games Launcher does not send the
					<code>deploymentID parameter</code>.</li>
				<li>If you archive a deployment, the Developer Portal does not automatically remove any deployment IDs on artifacts that point to this archived deployment. You must do one of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Remove the deployment IDs from the artifacts.</li>
						<li>Set new deployment IDs on the artifacts.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You can promote an artifact (move it from your Dev sandbox to your staging or Live sandbox, or move it from your Staging sandbox to your Live sandbox) without a deployment ID.</li>
				<li>When you promote an artifact, any associated deployment ID is not promoted with it. As a result, the deployment ID in the destination sandbox is empty. For example, if you promote an artifact from your Dev sandbox to your Staging sandbox, then the associated deployment ID in your Staging sandbox is empty. If you want the artifact in the destination sandbox to have a deployment ID, then you must set the deployment ID manually after you promote the artifact.</li>
