			<p>When you gather the email addresses from users of your product, you gain a valuable opportunity to keep them informed about future product updates and discounts. When users actively provide their email addresses, they indicate their interest in your product and their desire to stay informed.</p>
			<p>You can now directly reach these users through your existing newsletter or email campaigns.</p>
			<p>In addition, it's an excellent opportunity to introduce this audience to other games in the same franchise, or similar products you offer that are likely to grab their interest.</p>
