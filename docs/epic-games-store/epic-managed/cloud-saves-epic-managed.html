			<p>Cloud Saves are enabled by default for users, however, they must be configured by your Release Manager for each product before you begin testing. Your Release Manager will configure the cloud saves on your Staging artifact so that you can test the feature. You need to provide your Release Manager with the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Save folder location: This is where your game saves locally on a user's machine. If your game runs on both Mac and Windows, provide both locations.</li>
				<li>Exclusions: Any files that you want to exclude from the cloud save.</li>
				<li>Maximum folder size: The maximum size of the save folder. If exceeded, a user gets the error "<em>The save files are too large to upload</em>."
