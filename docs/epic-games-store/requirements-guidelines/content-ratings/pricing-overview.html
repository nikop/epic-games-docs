			<p>In the Epic Games Store publishing tools, you can set and manage prices for your products at any time. After setting a price tier for your product, we provide Epic-delivered regional prices for all available regions and currencies for your convenience. You can also update these prices as needed by creating your own custom price tiers. Modifications to existing product prices and new custom price tiers are reviewed by the Epic Games Store team and typically processed within days of submission. While we check for typos and input mistakes, we cannot guarantee that we will catch everything. To ensure your prices are accurate, review your pricing information before submitting for review.</p>

				<h2 id="pricing-your-product">Pricing Your Product</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Pricing is one of the most important decisions to make as you set up your product. While pricing your product, consider the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your production costs</li>
				<li>Your target audience</li>
				<li>Perceived value of the product</li>
				<li>Gameplay duration and replayability</li>
				<li>Similar products on the market today</li>
				<li>Upcoming discounts and sales you may offer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, consider regularly evaluating and adjusting prices based on user feedback and changes in the market. Your pricing strategy helps you build a sustainable business while delivering value to your audience.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="pricing-restrictions">Pricing Restrictions</h2>
			</div>
			<p>While the Epic Games Store is committed to facilitating fair and competitive pricing for your products, ultimately the prices you set are up to you. However, note that some regions have laws in place to protect users against price gouging and price manipulation. To maintain this commitment, the following rules apply to all prices:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No price changes during an active discount of an offer.
					<ul>
						<li>Prices can change immediately after a discount ends, however, if the price is lowered, the lowered price can not be lower than the previous discounted price.</li>
						<li>After 30 days, the price can be lowered below the previous discounted price.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Prices cannot be changed if a discount is scheduled within the next 30 days.</li>
				<li>Prices cannot be changed within 30 days of launch.</li>
				<li>If a product is free in one currency or region, it should also be free in all other currencies and regions. Likewise, if a product is not free in one currency/region, it should also not be free in other currencies/regions.</li>
				<li>If a product has pre-purchase enabled:
					<ul>
						<li>Pre-purchase prices cannot change once the pre-purchase period has started.</li>
						<li>Pre-purchase prices must match the launch price.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="regional-pricing">Regional Pricing</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Epic Games Store provides default price tiers for your convenience. Base prices for offers associated with your product are set in USD. Once set, the Regional Pricing section populates prices in local currency for the 43 local currencies we support and in USD for any unsupported currencies.</p>
			<p>You can use any of our Epic-delivered regional prices or create your own custom price tiers. Our Epic-delivered prices are developed using regional exchange rates, local purchasing power, and information on local market norms. With constant economic changes, we review our regional prices on a regular basis and may make adjustments to keep up with market fluctuations.</p>
			<p>As mentioned, you can create custom price tiers to determine your own regional pricing in place of the Epic-delivered price tiers. Custom price tiers must be reviewed by the Epic Games Store team. Once reviewed, the price tier can be assigned to your product offers. Custom price tiers are not associated with any offers by default. To learn more, review

			<div>
				<h2 id="discount-pricing">Discount Pricing</h2>
			</div>
			<p>You can also create and manage discounts for your product offers. You can create discounts as part of your own campaign, as well as participate in Epic-led preset campaigns (e.g., the Epic Games Mega Sale). After creating a discount, you must submit it for review by the Epic Games Store team. To learn more, review
