			<p>An organization is a group (usually a company or other business, such as a game studio or publisher) that creates and owns products. When you use Epic Games Store, you create an organization during the onboarding process. You can manage your organization on the Organization page of the Developer Portal at any time.</p>
			<p>In the Developer Portal, you associate your Epic Games account with an organization. Each Epic Games account that you associate with an organization is a “member” of the organization.</p>
			<p>With the appropriate subscriptions, members of an organization can access these Epic Games tools and services:</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Epic Tools</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Unreal Engine</li>
				<li>Twinmotion</li>
				<li>MetaHuman</li>
				<li>RealityCapture</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This page and this set of documentation does not provide information on these tools. To access the relevant documentation, see the Epic Tools section of the Developer Portal -
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/dev-portal-intro">Introduction</a>

			</div>
			<p>To access the Epic Games Store publishing tools for your product, you must complete the following tasks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Pay Submission Fee</strong>: You must pay a submission fee of $100 USD (or local currency equivalent), plus local taxes if applicable, for each product you intend to distribute. While this fee is non-refundable, you recoup it in the payment made to you after your product has earned at least $1000.00 in revenue from Epic Games Store purchases (and in-game purchases using the Epic Payment Platform). If you have any questions about the submission fee, create a private discussion using this support website:
					<a href="https://eoshelp.epicgames.com/s/private-question-page">eoshelp.epicgames.com</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Complete Product Questionnaire</strong>: You must complete a preliminary questionnaire about the product that you want to distribute on the Epic Games Store. Your responses to these questions are non-binding and are intended to help us identify the best support for your product.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You only complete these tasks once per product.</p>
			<p>To complete the tasks, follow the steps below.</p>

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once you have completed these steps, you can see the Epic Games Store section of the Developer Portal for your product.</li>
