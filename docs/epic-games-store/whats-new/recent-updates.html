				<strong>Developer Portal</strong>
			</p>
			<p>We have made some updates to the user interface in the Developer Portal. We have made the following improvements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Epic Tools</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added the Epic Tools section for your organization. Use this to purchase and assign seats for Unreal Engine, Twinmotion, RealityCapture, and MetaHuman.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Your Products</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Updated the “Products” section on the left navigation to “Your Products”. This makes clear the distinction between your products and the tools provided by Epic Games (known as “Epic Tools”) that you can use.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Organization Profile</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a Profile tab in the Organization page. Use this to configure and update your organization’s profile, and choose to make your organization public on the Epic Developer Community website.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Roles</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added an organization member default role. An account holder with the organization member default role has no permissions on the Developer Portal. Use this when you want to assign an Epic Tool seat to your team member, but do not need to give them further permissions in your organization.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>VAT Information</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a Claim VAT/Sales Tax section. Use this to specify your company’s VAT details. We add your VAT number to purchases you make on the Developer Portal.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong>
				These updates do not change the service of Epic Games Store or Epic Online Services.</p>

				<strong>Promotional Content</strong>
				<br>
				We added a new requirement that if your offer promotes your own (or someone else's) brand, product, or business, then you must declare it as promotional content in the offer settings. If you make this declaration, then the Epic Games Store labels the offer as promotional content.</p>
			<p>This applies only If your organization is new to the Epic Games Store. If your organization is already on the Epic Games Store, then you have until February 17, 2025 before you need to make this declaration on your offers.</p>

				<strong>Trader Information</strong>
				<br>
				Before you can sell products on the Epic Games Store, you must put your Epic Games Store organization through trader verification.</p>

				<strong>Specify Deploments on Artifacts</strong>
				<br>
				If your product uses the Epic Online Services (EOS) SDK, then your build must specify the correct deployment when it initializes the EOS SDK. To make sure that your build can identify the correct deployment, you can now set a deployment ID on your artifact. When the Epic Games Launcher starts your build, it sends this deployment ID to your build as a command-line parameter.</p>

				<strong>Reminder: In-App Purchases Requirement</strong>

				If your product contains in-app purchases, this information must be clearly stated on your store presence. This helps foster a transparent and trustworthy store experience for store users.</p>

				<strong>Improved Offer Management</strong>
				<br>
				For improved offer management, you now unlink base offers from Edition-type offers in the Dev sandbox. This improvement helps ensure updates that you make to base offers are reflected in their associated editions.</p>
			<p>Previously, when you made an update to base offer, you had to push both the base offer and any associated editions to your Stage sandbox. If you did not push the editions to Stage, the base offer updates were not reflected in those editions.</p>
			<p>With this update, you no longer need to push editions to Stage along with your base offer. You can now unlink your base offer from associated editions prior to making updates. When the base offer is updated, relinking that offer to your editions ensures they are associated with the most up-to-date version of your base offer.</p>
