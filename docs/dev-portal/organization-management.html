			<p>In Epic Games Store and Epic Online Services (EOS), data relating to your account in the Developer Portal is organized in a hierarchy, with “organization” at the top.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="what-is-an-organization">What is an Organization?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>An organization is a group (usually a company or other business, such as a game studio or publisher) that creates and owns products. In the Developer Portal, you associate your Epic Games account with an organization. Each Epic Games account associated with an organization is a “member” of the organization.</p>
			<p>Members of an organization manage products that you add to the Developer Portal on behalf of the  organization. Your organization can have multiple members.</p>
			<p>For an overview of the Epic data hierarchy, see the following documentation:</p>

				<strong>When You First Sign In</strong>

				<a href="#domains">Domains</a>
				section of this page.)</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
			</div>

			<p>The default roles are listed on the Roles tab of the Organization page in the Developer Portal. Admins can create custom roles.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Custom Roles</strong>
				<br>

			</div>
			<p>This tab shows money paid to your organization. You can only see the contents of this tab if you have set up your tax profile and Hyperwallet account. Use the Tax Info tab to do this.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="agreements">Agreements</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Use the Agreements tab to review the active agreements with Epic Games for your organization.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
			</div>
			<p>This is the representation of your organization in the Developer Portal and, if you choose it, in the Epic Developer Community (EDC) (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community">dev.epicgames.com/community</a>).</p>
			<p>Your organization profile includes a profile image (for example a company logo), a cover image (a background image), text to introduce your organization, and social media links (for example a link to your organization’s LinkedIn profile).</p>
			<p>The default profile setting is private: only members of your organization can see your profile in the Developer Portal. If you make your profile public then all users of the EDC can also see it.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Your Organization’s Profile as a Public Profile</strong>
				<br>
				You can choose to make your organization profile public on the EDC (<a href="http://dev.epicgames.com/community">dev.epicgames.com/community</a>).</p>
			<p>If you do this, members of your organization are associated with your organization publicly on the EDC. This means that any activity by members of your organization on the EDC is publicly associated with your organization’s profile.</p>
			<p>For example, when a member of your organization creates guides (known as “tutorials”) in the EDC or answers questions in the EDC forums, all users of the EDC can see this activity on the profile of your organization, as well as the member’s personal profile. This helps users of the EDC discover your organization and any tutorials your organization's members create.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Make your Organization’s Profile Public</strong>
				<br>
				To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/porta">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), click
					<strong>Organization</strong>
					from the left navigation.</li>
				<li>On the Organization page, click
					<strong>Profile</strong>.</li>
				<li>You must add the following to your organization’s profile content, if you don’t you can’t make it public:
					<ol>
						<li>Enter text for the organization biography.</li>
						<li>Upload a profile image</li>
						<li>Upload a background image.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Select
					<strong>Make this profile public</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In the Setting tab, you can configure your organization type, domains, and console developer access.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="general-settings">General Settings</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Use this section to configure information about your organization such as changing its name, country, or adding an address or support email.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="claim-vattax">Claim VAT/Tax</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Use this section to add information about your organization’s tax (or VAT) status. If your organization is registered to pay tax (or VAT), Epic Games might not have to charge you tax (or VAT) on any products or services it provides to your organization.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="organization-type">Organization Type</h4>
			</div>
			<p>An admin or owner can configure your organization type. Your organization type can either be an individual or a company:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Individual</strong>: The default type for an organization. This type indicates that all of the members of the organization are acting on their personal behalf.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Enterprise</strong>: This type is available for incorporated entities. It indicates that your organization represents a legal entity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: If you change your organization type to Enterprise, you cannot change it back to Individual.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="domains">Domains</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Use this tab to add and verify website and email addresses (“domains”) associated with your organization.</p>
			<p>Verifying your domain protects you, all your players or users, and Epic Games from malicious activities, such as brand spoofing, phishing, malware, stolen identity, and copyright infringement.</p>
			<p>For guidance on the domain verification process, see the documentation: EOS Epic Account Services -
				<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review/domain-verification">Domain Verification</a>.</p>
			<p>You must add and verify your domain in order to complete the following processes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Email notifications.<br>
					(Documentation: See the
					<a href="#notifications">Notifications</a>
					section of this page.)</li>
				<li>Brand review.<br>
					This is essential to using Epic Account Services in your product.<br>
					(Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review">EOS Epic Account Services: Brand Review</a>.)</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="console-developer-access">Console Developer Access</h4>
			</div>
			<p>You can only access the EOS SDK for console downloads, and their associated documentation, if you have the appropriate permissions. This section provides information on how to get the permissions.</p>

					<strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
