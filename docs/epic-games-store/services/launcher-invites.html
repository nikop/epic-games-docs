			<p>
				<strong>Artifacts</strong>
				represent your downloadable, playable content such as game clients and DLC, and are a concept specific to the
				<strong>Epic Games Store (EGStore)</strong>.</p>
			<p>The Epic Games Store can receive game invites from EOS-integrated games via an explicit opt-in system. This allows users outside of the store ecosystem to invite EGStore users to their game session.</p>
			<p>You must map your
				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/product-management#deployments">deployments</a>
				to your Epic Games Store artifacts to route the EOS-initiated invites through the EGStore ecosystem to your users in the
				<strong>Epic Games Launcher</strong>.</p>
			<div>
				<p>Leveraging your artifacts to expose game invites on the Epic Games Launcher requires the EOS SDK 1.11 or higher.</p>
			</div>
			<p>To map your artifacts to deployments:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the
					<strong>Environments</strong>
					tab of the
					<strong>Product Settings</strong>
					for your product in the
					<strong>Developer Portal</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click the
					<strong>Deployments</strong>
					button for the specific sandbox to work in and click
					<strong>More Options</strong>
					to
					<strong>Link Artifacts</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select your artifacts to link with that specific deployment and arrange them in order by priority.</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>When you have multiple artifacts mapped to a single deployment, the Launcher client routes the game invite to the first locally-installed artifact that it finds in the order you specify in the Developer Portal.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<p>Do not map your DLC artifacts to a deployment; only "base game" launchable artifacts should be mapped to deployments.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Having multiple artifacts is typically a scenario for you as a developer because your end users should only have the production 
				<!-- -->artifact
				<!-- --> installed. This allows multiple internal test artifacts that you can independently validate against the same EOS 
				<!-- -->deployment
				<!-- -->.</p>
			<p>Your production artifact should always be mapped to your production deployment to ensure that invites deliver to your users in the EGStore.</p>
