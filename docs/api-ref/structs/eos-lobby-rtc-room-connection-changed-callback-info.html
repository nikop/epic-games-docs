This may be because: the associated lobby was Left or Destroyed, the connection to the lobby was interrupted, or because the SDK is being shutdown. If the lobby connection returns (lobby did not permanently go away), we will reconnect. EOS_NoConnection: There was a network issue connecting to the server. We will attempt to reconnect soon. EOS_RTC_UserKicked: The user has been kicked by the server. We will not reconnect. EOS_RTC_UserBanned: The user has been banned by the server. We will not reconnect. EOS_ServiceFailure: A known error occurred during interaction with the server. We will attempt to reconnect soon. EOS_UnexpectedError: Unexpected error. We will attempt to reconnect soon.</td>
