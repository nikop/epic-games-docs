			<p>In Epic Games Store and Epic Online Services (EOS), data relating to your Epic Games account is organized in a hierarchy. Products, sandboxes and deployments are part of the hierarchy.</p>
			<p>You manage product, sandbox, and deployment in the Product Settings page.</p>
			<p>For an overview of the Epic data hierarchy, see the following documentation:</p>
			<ul>

				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h2 id="what’s-a-product">What’s a Product?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>A product is a game or other software application that uses one or more EOS service, Epic Games Store distribution, or Epic Games Store service. A product is owned by an organization and contains all information relevant to that software application, such as add-ons, mods, editors, development builds, and distributions on different platforms.</p>
			<p>Your organization can have multiple products. You can have multiple versions of a product.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You decide on the names for your products. We recommend setting product names and any associated information to codenames during development. This acts as an additional safeguard for sensitive information. (The default product name comes from the
				<code>ProductName</code>
				field in the EOS SDK API
				<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/en-US/api-ref/functions/eos-initialize">EOS_Initialize</a>.)</p>
			<p>There is information on sandboxes and deployments, in the
				<a href="#sandboxes-and-deployments">Sandboxes and Deployments</a>
				section of this page.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="product-settings-page">Product Settings Page</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The Developer Portal has a Product Settings page where you can configure data relating to your product, including sandboxes, and deployments.</p>

				<h3 id="sandboxes">Sandboxes</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Use this tab to manage sandboxes and deployments. Because deployments are associated with a sandbox, you create, edit, or archive the deployments in the Sandbox tab of the Developer Portal’s Product Settings page.</p>
			<p>For more information, see the
				<a href="#sandboxes-and-deployments">Sandboxes and Deployments</a>
				section of this page.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="identity-providers">Identity Providers</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Identity providers are real-world organizations providing user accounts, such as a Google account, a Steam account, an Xbox Live account, or Epic Games account, among others.</p>
			<p>You can use Epic Online Services (EOS) crossplay to enable your product users to interact regardless of the identity provider they use, and regardless of the storefront or platform they use to access your product.</p>
			<p>Using a game as an example, this enables players with accounts from different storefronts or platforms to play your game together. For example, the following players can play your game together:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A player on a PC using their Epic Games account</li>
				<li>A player on a PC using their Steam account.</li>
				<li>A player on a PlayStation using their PSN account.</li>
				<li>A player on an Xbox using their Xbox Live account.</li>
				<li>And players using many other account types and platforms.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With crossplay, players can share their in-game unlocked achievements, see each other on friends lists, and be in sessions and lobbies with each other.</p>
			<p>For details of supported identity providers and how to configure them see the documentation: Developer Portal -
				<a href="/docs/en-USdev-portal/identity-provider-management">Identity Provider Management</a>.</p>

				<h3 id="clients">Clients</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Use this tab to configure your product’s clients and manage your product’s client policies.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="what-are-clients">What are clients?</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Clients are any software program that accesses EOS services for your product. A client can be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Game clients used by players on their local devices to play your game.</li>
						<li>Software clients used by software users on their local devices to run your software application.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Trusted servers as clients:
					<ul>
						<li>Your product might use non-EOS services that are complementary to EOS services. These non-EOS services are known as “trusted servers”. Trusted servers require access to your product's user data, so you must add them as a "client".</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Any other use for a client you choose.</li>
			</ul>

					- an overview of the Epic Games Store and EOS data hierarchy and how clients fit into it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You must associate a client with client policies. You cannot create a client without a client policy in place.</p>

				<a href="/docs/dev-portal/client-credentials">Client Credentials and Client Policy Management</a>.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="player-groups">Player Groups</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Use player groups to grant users who are not members of your organization, access to your private sandboxes and deployments. By default, private sandbox or deployment access is denied to users who are not members of your organization, unless you give them permission by using player groups.</p>
			<p>For example, you can add your product’s QA team to a player group so the team can test a private version of your product.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Warnings</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Using Epic Account Services</strong>
					<br>
					If your product is using Epic Account Services, but you have not yet completed the brand review process, user access is denied to non-organization members, even if you have granted them access through player groups.
					<br>
					For information on the process, see the documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-account-services/brand-review/brand-review-process">Brand Review Process</a>.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Members have automatic access</strong>
					<br>
					Members of an organization have user access to their organization’s private sandboxes by default.

						<strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Account Ids</strong>
							are unique IDs for user accounts provided by a real-world organization listed in the Identity Provider dropdown list.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Identity Provider</strong>
							is a dropdown list of real-world organizations providing user accounts, such as a Google account, a Steam account, an Xbox Live account, or an Epic Games account, among others. You can only add account IDs to player groups if the account IDs are provided by these identity providers.
							<br>
							For more information, see the

						) and select the action you want to take.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: The Developer Portal uses the terms “user group” and “player group” interchangeably.</p>
			<p>Once you finish creating player groups, you can select the sandboxes and deployments this group can access. Once you create the group and give it access to a private sandbox, all users in that player group can access deployments in that private sandbox.</p>
			<div>
				<h5 id="bulk-import-user-account-ids">Bulk Import User Account IDs</h5>
			</div>
			<p>You can import a list of user account IDs with a .CSV file. This is more efficient if you have many IDs from multiple identity providers.</p>
			<p>To streamline importing multiple IDs, you can download a template with the correct .CSV file format from the Create new group or Update user group page. Click

			<div>
				<h4 id="what-is-a-sandbox">What is a Sandbox?</h4>
			</div>
			<p>A sandbox is an environment for versions of a product.  You can use sandboxes to keep the different stages of your product's development and release cycle separate.</p>
			<p>As well as a public sandbox (“Live”), for deployments of your live product accessible to users, you can have private sandboxes (“Dev”, “Stage”). You can use private sandboxes to ensure that your product’s deployments for development and testing are not visible to people outside your organization.</p>
			<p>A sandbox contains Epic Games Store-related information, mod configurations, and one or more deployments of a game.</p>
			<p>Documentation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developer Portal -
					<a href="/docs/dev-portal/dev-portal-intro#your-organization-and-products">Introduction - Your Organization and Products</a>
					- an overview of the Epic Games Store and EOS data hierarchy and how sandboxes fit into it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you set up a product in the Developer Portal, by default, there is one public sandbox called “Live”. You can get two additional sandboxes, “Dev” and “Stage” that default to private to your organization.
				<br>
				Typically you use “Dev” for development deployments and “Stage” for QA testing deployments.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="get-additional-sandboxes">Get Additional Sandboxes</h4>
			</div>
			<p>To get the two additional default sandboxes, apply for either of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Distribute your product on the Epic Games Store.
					<br>
					Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools">Publishing Tools</a>.</li>
				<li>Use Epic Games Store achievements.
					<br>
					Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/services/epic-achievements">Epic Games Store Achievements</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get additional sandboxes for a different use, for example to test identity providers (related to using the Auth Interface and Connect Interface):</p>
			<p>Contact Epic Games Support using a private discussion.
				<br>
				See the support page section:
				<a href="/docs/support#using-the-eos-developer-support-website">Using the EOS Developer Support Website</a>
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="configure-sandboxes">Configure Sandboxes</h4>
			</div>
			<p>For each sandbox, you can configure the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deployments.</li>
				<li>Identity providers. (Documentation:
					<a href="/docs/dev-portal/identity-provider-management">Identity Provider Management</a>.)</li>

				<h3 id="deployments">Deployments</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4 id="what-is-a-deployment">What is a Deployment?</h4>
			</div>
			<p>A deployment is an iteration of your game that contains a unique set of player progression data, such as achievements, statistics, and matchmaking. This player progression data includes achievement statuses, statistics, and any ongoing matches in matchmaking.</p>

			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong>Note</strong>: You can associate a deployment with only one sandbox. If you want parallel deployments in two different sandboxes, you must create one deployment for each sandbox.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="manage-deployments">Manage Deployments</h4>
			</div>
			<p>Because deployments are associated with a sandbox, you create, edit, or archive the deployments in the Sandbox tab of the Developer Portal’s Product Settings page.</p>
			<p>To manage deployments:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Go to your product’s Product Settings page in the Developer Portal and click
						<strong>Sandboxes</strong>.
