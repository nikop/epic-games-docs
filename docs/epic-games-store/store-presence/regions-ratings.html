			<p>Regions and Ratings is one of two sets of configuration you must complete to publish your product on the Epic Games Store. See the following documentation for guidance:
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/store-presence/store-config.mdx">Configure Store Settings</a>.</p>
			<p>You manage your product's regions for distribution, as well as its age ratings through the Developer Portal in the Regions and Ratings section of the Store Settings page. You manage these settings in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Obtain IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) ratings for your product.</li>
				<li>Upload traditional ratings from other official rating authorities.</li>
				<li>Determine which regions to distribute your product in.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sections below describe these.</p>
			<div>
				<h2 id="page-navigation">Page Navigation</h2>
			</div>
			<p>To manage ratings and distribution, go to the Store Settings page.</p>
			<p>To do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to your product page:
					<ul>
						<li>In the Developer Portal (<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal">dev.epicgames.com/portal</a>), from the left navigation, under
							<strong>Your Products</strong>, click the name of your product. (<strong>Note</strong>: You might have to click
							<strong>Back to organization</strong>
							before you can do this.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Once you are in your product page, from the left navigation, click
					<strong>Epic Games Store</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the left navigation, click
					<strong>Store Settings</strong>.</li>
				<li>On the Store Settings page, click
					<strong>Regions and Ratings</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h2 id="ratings">Ratings</h2>
			</div>
			<p>While the Epic Games Store does not require all products to be rated, ratings are required in the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Some regions, such as South Korea or Australia, require ratings from specific authorities in order to distribute products in those areas.</li>
				<li>Products that have received ratings from
					<strong>any</strong>
					official rating authority must display those ratings on their product page in the storefront.</li>
				<li>Products leveraging blockchain or NFT technology in any capacity must be rated in order to be distributed on the Epic Games Store.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>You can choose to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store as an unrated title in regions without specific requirements. However, unrated products are treated as having the highest-level maturity rating available in regions where they are distributed.</div>
			<p>To best reach potential users on the storefront, obtaining ratings for your product is
				<strong>highly recommended</strong>. If you do not have ratings for your product, you can easily obtain an IARC rating through the Epic Games Store publishing tools.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h3>
			</div>
			<p>Before configuring any ratings for your product, consider the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Australia, Brazil, and Russia require IARC or region-specific ratings for products to be distributed in these areas.  To learn more, review
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/iarc-ratings">IARC Ratings</a>.</li>
				<li>GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee) ratings are legally required to distribute products in South Korea. This requirement applies to any playable builds (including demo and early-access builds) that are available to the public. To learn more, review
					<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/game-rating-korea">Distribution in Korea</a>.</li>
				<li>Ratings are configured at the base product level. Any ratings provided are used for your base product offer as well as any other offers associated with your product (such as editions or DLC). Configuring ratings per offer is not currently supported.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h3 id="completing-the-initial-setup">Completing the Initial Setup</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When first configuring ratings for your product, you are presented with a short series of questions about
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/iarc-ratings">IARC Ratings</a>. These questions guide you in completing one of the following required actions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Addding an existing IARC rating to your product by entering your IARC Certificate ID or Global Rating ID.</li>
				<li>Obtaining an IARC rating for your product by completing the IARC questionnaire.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: When you start the questionnaire, the following restrictions apply:
							<ul>
								<li>You must complete the questionnaire. You cannot opt out of IARC ratings after you start the questionnaire.</li>
								<li>You have three hours to complete the questionnaire from the time that you start it. If you take longer than three hours, then you must start the questionnaire again.</li>
								<li>You cannot push your product to the Stage sandbox until you complete the process below and receive your rating.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Opting out of using IARC ratings for your product. (You can choose to opt in at a later time, as needed). After you opt out, you can choose to upload traditional ratings for your product or leave your product unrated.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: Unrated products are treated as having the highest-level maturity rating available in regions where they are distributed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Detailed steps and additional information for each of these actions are provided in the sections below.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Tip</strong>: If you have already configured ratings for your product, review the appropriate section below for information on updating existing ratings:</p>

				</li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<h4 id="add-an-existing-iarc-rating-to-your-product">Add an Existing IARC Rating to your Product</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If you have an existing IARC rating for your product, you must upload that rating in order to distribute your product on the Epic Games Store. To ensure a successful launch, we recommend completing this process
				<strong>before</strong>
				submitting your product for review.</p>
			<p>To add an existing IARC rating to your product, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Regions and Ratings section of the Store Settings page. To do this, see
					<a href="#page-navigation">Page Navigation</a>
					at the top of this page.</li>
				<li>In the Regions and Ratings section, click
					<strong>Edit</strong>. Then, click
					<strong>Ratings</strong>.</li>
				<li>When asked if you already have an IARC Certificate ID or Global Rating ID (GRID) for your product, select
					<strong>Yes</strong>
					and click
					<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>Enter your IARC Certificate ID/Global Rating ID and contact email. Then, click
					<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>You are then presented with an overview of the regional ratings assigned to your product as per IARC guidelines. Review this information for accuracy, then click
					<strong>Confirm</strong>
					to upload the ratings to your product.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once your IARC rating is uploaded, you can manage this information at any time by returning to the Regions and Ratings section of Store Settings. To learn more, review the
				<a href="#managing-iarc-ratings">Managing IARC Ratings</a>
				section</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="obtain-an-iarc-rating-for-your-product">Obtain an IARC Rating for your Product</h4>
			</div>
			<p>If you do not currently have an IARC rating for your product, you can receive one by completing the IARC questionnaire. This step is
				<strong>recommended</strong>
				to promote an optimal user experience.</p>
			<div>
				If you start the IARC questionnaire, you must complete it. You cannot opt out of IARC ratings after you start the questionnaire. You have three hours to complete the questionnaire from the time that you start it. If you take longer than three hours, then you must start the questionnaire again. Additionally, you cannot push your product to the Stage sandbox until you complete this process and receive your rating.</div>
			<p>To obtain an IARC rating for your product, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Regions and Ratings section of the Store Settings page. To do this, see

					<strong>Finished</strong>
					to the bottom right to return to the Epic Games Developer Portal.

			</div>
			<p>When you obtain an IARC rating for your product, your product is assigned a set of regional ratings from a variety of rating authorities as per IARC guidelines. At times, you may notice ratings from a specific authority change automatically without any action from you.</p>
			<p>Such updates can occur due to the following:</p>
			<p>*The rating authority amended the rating determination made by the automated IARC system. *A traditional rating was provided for your product that supersedes the determination made by the automated IARC system.</p>
			<p>If one of your assigned ratings has changed, you will receive an email notification directly from IARC. No action is required from you to facilitate these updates.</p>
			<div>
				<h3 id="managing-traditional-ratings">Managing Traditional Ratings</h3>
			</div>
			<p>In the Regions and Ratings section of Store Settings, you can upload product ratings obtained from
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/ratings-overview#supported-ratings-systems">traditional rating authorities</a>, such as ESRB or PEGI. If your product has received any traditional ratings, you
				<strong>must</strong>
				upload this information regardless of whether you choose to leverage IARC ratings.</p>
			<div>
				If your product has a traditional rating pending, you cannot distribute your product on the Epic Games Store until you receive and upload that rating.</div>
			<p>To upload traditional ratings, follow the steps below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the Developer Portal, go to the Regions and Ratings section of the Store Settings page. To do this, see
					<a href="#page-navigation">Page Navigation</a>
					at the top of this page.</li>
				<li>In the Regions and Ratings section, click
					<strong>Edit</strong>. Then, select
					<strong>Ratings</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the rating you wish to upload from the list of supported authorities.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Note</strong>: If needed, you can replace a specific rating you received through the IARC system with a traditional rating. To do so, select the authority from the list and choose
							<strong>Replace with Traditional Rating</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Complete the brief form to provide details about your product’s rating. Depending on the authority selected, completing this form may include:
					<ul>
						<li>Uploading the rating license or certificate issued by the rating agency in PDF format.</li>
						<li>Selecting the appropriate rating category.</li>
						<li>Specifying the
							<a href="#content-descriptors-and-interactive-elements">content descriptors and interactive elements</a>
							that influence the rating category (i.e., violence, language, or in-game purchases).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Review the information provided for the rating authority, then click
					<strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 3-5 as needed for each traditional rating available for your product.</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<h4 id="ratings-and-the-review-process">Ratings and the Review Process</h4>
			</div>
			<p>In order to distribute your product on the storefront, you must submit it for review by the Epic Games Store team. As part of this review, the ratings, descriptors, and interactive elements you include in your uploaded ratings are compared against the certificates you provide.</p>
			<p>You can add, remove, or edit ratings and their associated descriptors and interactive elements even if you have already pushed your product to your
				<a href="/docs/epic-games-store/publishing-tools/publishing-process/release-management">Stage sandbox</a>. For example, you can add ratings for additional regions in which you intend to launch your product. To update your rating information, first complete the desired changes in the Dev sandbox. Then, push those changes to the Stage sandbox and submit them for review.</p>
			<div>
				<h4 id="content-descriptors-and-interactive-elements">Content Descriptors and Interactive Elements</h4>
			</div>
			<p>In addition to the official rating classification, some authorities also require descriptors, interactive element disclosures, or both. Descriptors and interactive elements indicate to users why your product received its specific rating. If your rating certificate includes any descriptors or interactive elements, you must provide this information along with your rating classification.</p>
			<p>In the following example, Fortnite received a PEGI rating of 12. The descriptors show that PEGI assigned this rating due to the presence of violent content and in-game purchases.</p>
